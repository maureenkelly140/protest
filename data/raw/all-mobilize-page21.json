We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*\n\nFind all 50501 South Dakota socials at: www.linktr.ee/50501sd",

    "description": "If you haven't heard about it, _On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century_ is a book published in 2017 by Timothy Snyder, a historian of 20th-century Europe. Rachel Maddow has repeatedly brought him back to her show to explain how to make sense of the current moment. ([Here is a recent appearance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNrbInmlHhA)). This book is more relevant than ever. Many of the warnings in the books are being played out in front of our eyes right now. So it's important to know how to recognize these signs, and more importantly, what we could learn from history and do differently this time. \n\nThe book is fairly short, only 126 pages. It would take just an afternoon to finish. If you need to purchase a copy, consider buying from a local bookstore.\n\nBonus, Stacey Abrams is also doing a book club with this book on her [podcast](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/assemblyrequired/). So once you finish it, you can jump there and learn more insights from her.",

So we're using our voices and heading to Chris Smith's office to tell him \"No Cuts\".\n\nWe'll be rallying on the grassy area in front of Chris Smith's office on Route 35 so we can be seen by passing motorists.\n\nThis is intended to be a friendly and peaceful rally. First time activists are especially welcome.\n\nBring your signs, American flags, noisemakers, musical instruments and protest music.\n\nIf you would like to stop into Mr. Smith’s Middletown office to leave a message or tell your story, you’ll need to call ahead to schedule an appointment: (732)780-3035.",

NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n#NOKINGS\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",

    "description": "A campaign for a Day of Female Solidarity and Empowerment on June 24, 2025—the anniversary of Roe v. Wade’s repeal. The idea is simple yet powerful: women and supporters of women everywhere wear red lipstick as a symbol of strength, resilience, and the ongoing fight for gender equality.\n\nVictory Red lipstick has long been a symbol of women’s power, particularly during World War II, when it was worn by women on the home front to represent strength, defiance, and patriotism. During this time, women stepped into roles previously held by men, contributing to the war effort while asserting their independence and resilience. They stood against facism, all while maintaining households and duties outside of their normal realm.",

    "description": "We’re weeks out from the NYC primary election, and the stakes are HIGH to block Andrew Cuomo and elect a mayor who will deliver on an affordable city, prioritizing the needs of working families above the demands of the rich and well-connected.   \n\nNYC doesn’t need to replace one power-hungry, scandal-ridden politician with another. We can elect a mayor we can all be proud of, but we must do it together! With multiple progressive candidates running, the NY WFP is taking on the challenge of keeping progressives united, asking voters to rank ALL candidates on the Working Families Slate—Adrienne Adams, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani and Zellnor Myrie—to make sure that a Working Families champion is the next mayor of New York City.\n\nTalking with voters face-to-face is THE most impactful way you can make a difference in this election. Join us to knock doors, engage with voters, and build our power across the city!\n\nNo experience necessary—your field captain will provide training and materials at the beginning of every canvass.

    "description": "This Memorial Day weekend, join us in celebrating veterans at a screening of the award-winning film Surviving the Silence - the true story of two women in love who helped change military policy. Presented by the Placer County Democratic Party.\n\n🎖️ When: Saturday, May 24 at 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM\n📍 Where: Presentation Hall, Kilaga Springs Lodge, Sun City Lincoln\n🎟️ Admission is free, but RSVP is required\n\nJoin us for a conversation with Col. Thompson and Barbara Brass after the screening as they share their personal journey and how they helped change the military policy that is now under attack by the Trump Administration.\n\nReserve your seat now and help us honor courage, love, and service to our country.\n\nInstead of an admission fee, we invite attendees to make a donation to the Placer County Democratic Party or the Placer LGBTQ+ Center.\n\nFILM SYNOPSIS:\nTwo women in love - Col. Pat Thompson and Barbara Brass - are surviving the demands of a closeted military career when one is forced to expel an Army hero for being a lesbian. The way she does it, however, leads to re-instatement and eventual change in military policy. They also candidly share how they wrestled with heart-wrenching choices, hiding their relationship, and struggling to protect their love while preserving Thompson's career - and became vibrant activists later in life.\n\nFilm trailer at https://www.survivingthesilence.com",

The Movement, a weekly Pro-Democracy, Anti-Trump, Anti-Putin vigil, gathers on a heavily trafficked Baltimore street corner on Wednesday evenings.\n\nWe invite others who feel the same way to join the Movement. You do not need to be old, you do not need to be in Baltimore, and you do not need to stand on Wednesdays, but we ask that you use the Wednesday Movement banner.\n\nIt’s easy:​ Reach out to friends and neighbors​. Make some signs (one should say “We Are The Wednesday Movement)​. Pick a day, time, and location that works for your group. And spread the word!  This is a grassroots initiative. It has the potential to change the world. Join with us and help make it happen!\n\nThe Lauraville Sign Wave will be held Rain or Shine but not if thunder/lightning are in the forecast.\n\nContact Anne George, 443-831-7528 for more information on initiating a sign wave in your area.",

They are going to extremes to empower Trump and enrich themselves, while cutting jobs and services for the rest of us. Now, they’re turning Flag Day into a celebration of Trump. \n\nWe’re standing together against the abuses of power, cruelty, and corruption. \n\nOn June 14, we gather to remind Trump and his enablers: America has NO KING!\n\nWhether you're outraged by attacks on civil rights, skyrocketing costs, abductions and disappearances, the gutting of essential services, or the assault on free speech—this moment is for you. Whether you've been in the fight for years or you're just fed up and ready to take action—this moment is for you.",

    "description": "We’re weeks out from the NYC primary election, and the stakes are high to BLOCK Andrew Cuomo and elect a mayor who will deliver on an affordable city, prioritizing the needs of working families above the demands of the rich and well-connected.\n\nNYC doesn’t need to replace one power-hungry, scandal-ridden politician with another. We can elect a mayor we can all be proud of, but we must do it together! With multiple progressive candidates running, the NY WFP is taking on the challenge of keeping progressives united, asking voters to rank ALL candidates on the Working Families Slate —> Adrienne Adams, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani and Zellnor Myrie <— to make sure that a Working Families champion is the next mayor of New York City.\n\nWhat is ‘Rank the Slate’? It means you vote by ranking ALL the Working Families candidates—1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd, and so on—so your preferences help decide the winner, not just your top pick.\n\nTalking with voters face-to-face is THE most impactful way you can make a difference in this election. Join us to knock doors, engage with voters, and build our power across the city!\n\nNo experience necessary! Your field captain will provide training and materials at the beginning of the canvass in Manhattan’s Chinatown.",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Come join us to knock doors and talk to voters about the upcoming primary election! \n\nAbout Daniel: As the first in his family to go to college, Daniel attended the University of Arizona where he interned for then-Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Daniel was a survivor of the 2011 Tucson shooting and was the first to administer first aid before EMTs arrived on the scene. Turning tragedy into resilience, Daniel decided to live a life of public service to protect Arizonan families and served on the Sunnyside School board (2011-2015) and was later elected to the Arizona State Legislature (2017-2022). Now, Daniel is running for Congress to Fight the Trump Administration to protect Arizonans' social security and healthcare access, expand federal dollars into public education, and lower the cost of everyday goods and housing.",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Flag Day – No Kings!   In America, we don’t do kings.\n\nOn June 14—Flag Day—the Felon wants tanks in the streets and a made-for-TV display of dominance for his birthday. A spectacle meant to look like strength. But real power isn’t staged in Washington. It rises up everywhere else.\n\nNo Kings is a nationwide day of defiance. From city blocks to small towns, from courthouse steps to community parks, we’re taking action to reject authoritarianism—and show the world what democracy really looks like.\n\nWe’re rallying in Woodstock, VA on the I-81 overpass at exit 283.\n\nWe’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.  See more at NoKings.org",

    "description": "Date: Saturday , May 10\nTime: 10AM to 12 PM\nPlace: Heritage Square ,400 N. Main St. 76574\n\nJoin us in Taylor for this nonpartisan demonstration in support of preserving our Democracy-and reclaiming the flag for all Americans!\n\nAs desired/able, please bring your own sign and flag, water, and wear comfortable shoes.  If you'd like to make a sign on site, please come early (9:45), as we will have some materials available.  The plan is to stand on the perimeter of the square and show we care!\n\nSign guidelines:  Signs are most impactful if you use contrasting colors, and the letters are at least 1.5 inches tall, making them readable from 20 Ft. away!\n\nSuggested topics: Anything relating to the constitution , or any domestic programs/policies you are passionate about either protecting and/or speaking out against.\nNational Security( i.e. support NATO, support our Allies)\n\nOur constitutional crisis encompasses many urgent issues, such as  LGBTQIA rights, Immigration, Race, the administration's ridiculous stance on Autism., veterans rights, SS, Medicaid/Medicare. This is not an exhaustive list, by any means.\n\nWe would like to avoid provocative statements about the \"personalities\" involved, profanity, and issues unrelated to the current Constitutional crisis and focus on what's at stake policy-wise, and the impact on humanity. Our goal is to be able to engage with the community in a constructive manner.\nThank you for your understanding and support!\n\nJoin us on Facebook too- look for the group \"Demonstrations for Our Democracy - Taylor, Tx for all current details about this and each demonstration here.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you out there.  Thank you for joining us!",

Together at this event, we will learn how we can stand up for working families and affordable housing, vote our values, and make sure the rich pay their fair share!\n\nThe P-Patch is a 10 minute walk from the Othello lightrail station. \nBreakfast snacks, coffee, and water will be provided. \n\nPlease join us and bring friends or family!\n\n\nP.S.\nAs the event wraps up, some folks will be heading out to talk to neighbors about what their issues are and about WFP-endorsed candidates who align with our values: Alexis Mercedes Rinck and Dionne Foster.

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

The US Government has detained and deported people without due process or legal justification. \n\nIndivisible Highlands and Beyond, 302 United, and Indivisible Newark First State demand that Avelo Airlines changes course immediately!!\n\nBring signs! We will have some to share, but we urge you to continue making your own great/creative signs! \n\nWe'll rally on both sides of Rt. 13, so stay on whichever side of the highway you park on. Please do NOT cross the busy highway!\n\nParking Options:\n\nGo to Lot D, $7.00 per car, then walk to the nearby sidewalk along the DuPont Hwy. (The first section of Lot D is a quick right turn after passing the ChristianaCare-GoHealth Urgent Care, right next to the Wilmington Airport.The second section of Lot D is a right turn immediately after you past this first turn for lot D.  There is a sign for Lot D at this turn.)\n\nYou can create an account online ahead of time so you can complete your payment from home in advance.  We recommend taking this step ahead of time, so you can just park and join us. Go to this link to set up your parking account: https://p-123.com/. Click on the ‘create your account now’ button. You will be asked for the zone ID which is 10500. You will add your license plate number, then pay with a credit card. \nYou could also use this same link or a QR code once you arrive to pay.  The signs in the parking lot have this info.\nAt this link below you can see where Lot D (or Remote lot) is located:\nhttps://www.flyilg.com/parking-wilmington-airport-ilg\n\nParking is also available behind the IHOP across the street: specifically, try the large shopping area lot between IHOP and Planet Fitness. (Again, if you park there, stay on that side of the road to rally along DuPont Hwy in front of the IHOP. Do NOT cross DuPont Hwy.)",

Lawmakers could revive the bill as early as January 2026 without fixing the real issues: underfunded classrooms, crumbling buildings, and staff shortages. Instead of investing in solutions, they’re setting the stage for more privatization and voucher schemes that threaten public education.\n\nThis takeover attempt was never about helping kids; it was a distraction from decades of disinvestment.\n\nNow it’s time to shape the future of MSCS together. Join Save Our Students (SOS) for a community listening session as we move into the next phase of building stronger, safer schools.\n\nRefreshments will be provided.",
