We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "HANDS OFF OUR HEALTHCARE Canvass with Us — Sunday, May 18\n\nThis Sunday, May 18, we’re taking action—and we need you with us. The LGBTQ+ community and other communities are under attack and we need to fight back through getting the word out about just how bad this budget is! \n\nTrump and Republicans in Congress are trying to gut Medicaid just to hand out massive tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. It’s wrong, and people are fired up. Now is the time to turn that energy into action.\n\nWe’re meeting in Palm Springs at 12:00 PM for a quick training, plus scripts and materials to make sure you feel confident and ready. Then we hit the doors together.\n\nThe pressure is working—politicians are already ducking their constituents because they know the public is watching. Let’s show them we’re not backing down.\n\nYour voice matters. Your presence makes a difference. Let’s do this—together.",

We're DOUBLING DOWN! \n\nOur protests have helped force Musk from DC but our work is far from done. Tesla's stock is UP because investors think we're going to fade away while Musk buys our elections, spews hate and lies on his social network, and bullies even conservative members of Congress into giving Trump the power of a KING. \n\nThe stakes couldn’t be higher. No one is coming to save us. Not politicians, not the media, not the courts. Our democracy has never faced someone with so much money and so little shame. \n\nPlease, join us. We need your voice. **Let's make some noise!**\n\nSee you Saturday!\n\n— Devin\n\nPS. For a list of other protests in the Seattle area, check DefundMusk.com.\n\nTesla Takedown is a peaceful protest movement. We oppose violence, vandalism and destruction of property.

    "description": "We need YOU as we rally in support of critical federal government services at risk of being lost forever. The U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystems Mission Area is responsible for many of the programs that serve millions of birders, hunters, anglers, gardeners, biologists, ecologists, and wildlife enthusiasts around the country–and importantly, the wildlife we treasure. This mission area is set to be completely eliminated in less than two weeks. \n\nWithout it, we will lose the backbone of environmental and ecological monitoring in the United States. This includes research that enables states to set hunting seasons, allows conservationists to understand and respond to declines in birds, bees and other wildlife, and tracks dangerous wildlife diseases and environmental pollutants that impact people and biodiversity. \n\nJoin us and our incredible lineup of speakers, including **renowned conservation leaders and authors Dr. J. Drew Lanham and Kenn Kaufman,** to learn about the critical work of the USGS, show off your best poster featuring your favorite wildlife species, and take action to urge your elected officials to save the Ecosystems Mission Area. Together, we will stand up for the public services that protect our communities, our wildlife, and our future!\n\n*This event is co-sponsored by American Fisheries Society, Ecological Society of America, Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, Society for Conservation Biology North America, The Wildlife Society, Entomological Society of America, American Bird Conservancy, Atlanta Botanical Garden, and America the Beautiful for All Coalition.*",

We the people have the power when we collectively take a stand. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nSHOW UP on these national days of defiance and defend democracy! This isn't just a march; it's a movement.\n\n#NoCrowns #NoThrowns #NoKings #JustWeThePeople #CommunityOverClowns #ConstitutionOverChaos #SolidarityNotCircuses #PeoplePower\n\n**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us.  \n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\n\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

Under current Republican leadership, the state legislature has rejected expanding Medicaid, slashed public education funding, and restricted access to reproductive health care. But we can change that. \n\nIf we start connecting with voters about the issues that matter to them this summer, we’ll have the power we need to flip this district next year. We can decide control of the Wisconsin State Senate and elect Democrats who will protect our health care, invest in public education, and stand up for reproductive freedom.\n\n**During this event, we’ll knock on doors and have powerful conversations with our neighbors.** We’ll listen to their concerns, share what’s at stake in the State Senate, and invite them to join our team. **Sign up here to build power in Racine County and fight for a better future for all Wisconsinites!**",

The LGBTQ+ community and other communities are under attack and we need to fight back through getting the word out about just how bad this budget is! \n\nTrump and Republicans in Congress are trying to gut Medicaid just to hand out massive tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. It’s wrong, and people are fired up. Now is the time to turn that energy into action.\n\nWe’re meeting for a quick training at 8am, and review scripts and materials to make sure you feel confident and ready. Then we hit the doors.\n\nThe pressure is working—politicians are already ducking their constituents because they know the public is watching. Let’s show them we’re not backing down.\n\nYour voice matters. Your presence makes a difference. Let’s do this—together.\n\nCan't canvass? Phone bank: https://www.mobilize.us/wfpower/event/789584/",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "This action is being mobilized by a number of local progressive groups and individuals including Indivisible NEO.\n\nDetails:\nPeacefully gather alongside your fellow Ohioans to tell Republican Gubernatorial candidate and DOGE flunkee Vivek Ramaswamy that his pro-billionaire, authoritarian agenda is not welcome in Ohio.  As of last Friday, Vivek is officially now the Ohio Republican Party’s endorsed candidate for governor.  \n\nThis action will be situated outside the Summit County Republican Party’s Lincoln Day Dinner where the plan is to garner the attention of attendees and any passersby.  \n\nPlease plan to meet outside Quaker Station by 5 pm for maximum visibility.\n\nParking may or may not be available at the venue. If not below are some nearby lots (likely all paid but you’ll have to check them individually):\n\nBroadway Parking Deck\n120 S Broadway (348 feet NW)\n\nCitiCenter Parking Deck\n132 S High St (587 feet NW)\n\nJohn S. Knight Center Parking Lot\n71 S High St (890 feet N)\n\nSummit County Parking Deck\n200 S High St (999 feet SW)\n\nWhat to bring:\nSigns, water and whatever you need to be comfortable standing/sitting outside for 2 hours.\n\nThere is plenty of material from Vivek to inform your signs.  This is the guy who:\n\n-Suggested Lake Erie be renamed Lake Ohio\n-Got fired from DOGE within days of his appointment\n-Promises the “Rust Belt” will be known as the “Platinum Belt” when he’s done with us\n-Envisions his Ohio as the state “where patriots across the country pack their bags to flock to, instead of Florida and Texas”\n-Propagates the Great Replacement Theory, believes Jan 6 was an “inside job” and of course the 2020 election was stolen\n-In a lecture to a Black American journalist about American history, claimed Black Americans had received equal rights immediately after the Civil War and they had none other than the National Rifle Association to thank for said equality.",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*\n\nJune 14th 9am-11am \n1 Courthouse Square, Inverness, Fl 34450",

The 287(g) program has historically eroded trust between law enforcement and immigrant families, making communities less safe and more divided.\n\nThe PWCDC Latino Caucus and community advocates firmly opposes any efforts to revive the 287(g) agreement, which was discontinued in 2020 due to widespread concerns about civil rights violations, discriminatory enforcement, and costly legal challenges. Reinstating it would represent a dangerous step backward and undermine the values of inclusion and due process.\n\nAttendees of the counter-protest are encouraged to bring signs, wear green as a symbol of unity, and submit public comments demanding humane, community-centered approaches to public safety.\n\nWe will not be silent while extremist agendas threaten the dignity and safety of our neighbors. We call on all people of conscience to stand with us in solidarity.",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego.

You'll dine with Lily at a private home in Gilroy, featuring homemade brunch delights and scrumptious baked goods with some gluten-free and vegan options. Lily will talk about her race and what’s at stake in this election in Virginia.\n\n** Suggested Ticket prices:** $30/person or free for those under 30. 100% of your donations will support Lily's campaign. We are grateful for all donations large and small! \n\n-**1.**  [Make Your Donation Here](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/sd023-va-franklin-southbay?refcode=25GilBrunch)   _(can also be made by check at the event)_\n\n-**2.** Sign up on this page in the upper right hand area to RSVP.\n\n**WHY THIS RACE**\n\nLily Franklin is running again in 2025 after narrowly losing the 2023 election for Virginia's 41st House District by just 183 votes. A former high school math teacher and chief of staff for Delegate Sam Rasoul, Franklin has been a dedicated advocate for affordable housing, accessible childcare, and quality education. Flipping this seat is crucial for Democrats to strengthen their majority in the House of Delegates and continue advancing progressive policies in Virginia.\n\n**WHY VIRGINIA**\n\nDemocrats must defend our House majority to keep Virginia a firewall against right-wing extremism. With momentum on our side, we can win key swing districts and build power for 2026. We also have a major opportunity to take back the Governor’s office and statewide seats, securing Virginia’s future as a stronghold for democracy.\n\nThank you for your donation & we look forward to seeing you there!\n\n_Please note that this event may be photographed and/or video or audio recorded.

    "description": "Conservative pundits and Trump ally Elon Musk have promoted a push to secure a federal pardon for Chauvin in recent months. On March 4, right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro launched an online petition on his video podcast and X, urging viewers to support the effort. Musk shared a clip from the podcast on his X page, writing “Something to think about.” Chauvin, 49, is currently serving concurrent state and federal prison sentences for killing Floyd, 46, during a police incident in which he knelt on Floyd’s neck and back for more than nine minutes. Chauvin was convicted by a 12-member jury on state charges for unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. He later pleaded guilty in a federal civil rights case for depriving Floyd of his rights.\n\nWednesday, May 21st, at 4 pm we need an\nALL OUT to the Hall of (In) Justice.\nCalling all folks, people who stayed tapped in since 2020 and those who we have missed- we need you now more than ever! Join us in the streets and STAY in the streets!\nFive years. Five years since a life was stolen. Five years of grief and pain for his family.\nFive years since the world stood up and gave a clarion call #DefundThePolice because #BlackLivesMatter.\nWe still say #GeorgeFloyd and we fight in his name, always.\nAs there is talk of a pardon for his killer, Derek Chauvin it is only symbolic of a larger problem. Police everywhere are increasing their violence on the streets and on campuses as students protest genocide.\nSimultaneously, police are given the green light by DAs, AGs, and the president to further their violence and corruption all while further criminalizing organizers, protestors, and activists.\nBut we demand not only an end to this shift, but the very systems that uphold it all.",

NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨We’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nWhen: Saturday, June 14, 12:00-1:00 pm\n\nWhere: Main Street, between Rouse Ave. and Willson Ave. (*NOT at the Courthouse this time)\n\nWhat to do:\n*Go to Main St. in downtown Bozeman\n*Pick a spot on the north or south side of Main St. between Rouse Ave. and Willson Ave. - spread out but stay visible\n*Hold signs, chant, sing, wave at cars, cheer at passersby\n*Follow the law and keep it peaceful\n*RESIST WITH JOY!!\n\nThe vision: a solid stationary line of 1000s of people stretching down Main Street\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

    "description": "Help us protest the world's most sensitive billionaire as he unconstitutionally dismantles our great country! It's easier to get at Trump through Elon Musk, and we're winning!  Elon may be \"stepping down\", but DOGE continues to destroy!\n\nSome notes about this specific location for protesting:\n- It is 100% legal to protest on the grass, directly across from Tesla.  Security and Glendale police are very friendly, and they are there to protect us from instigators. The police speak through me, so they don’t create conflict by approaching the crowd.\n\n- The Americana greens is actually a public park. But we are prohibited from standing in front of Tesla, or in the trolley road. Failure to do so could technically lead to arrest. Obviously walking up to and away from the protest with signs is fine. It’s nothing to stress about, just be cool.\n\n- There are shoppers and kids there. Please do not use profanity on your signs or from your mouth\n\n- Glendale law prohibits signs with poles or sticks that are thicker than 1/4\". So thin wood is fine! Larger is considered a possible weapon.\n\nFeel free to come up to me with any concerns during (or before) the protest.  \n\nIf you want to lead chants, go for it!  Let's have fun!\n\n- Joel",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

Local collage artist, zinester, and NEPASU member Kris K will lead us in making an 8-page minizine out of one sheet of paper.\n\nZines are small, handmade, often counter-culture self created booklets that can express a message or share art or information. In this fully interactive workshop, you will learn the historical significance of zines, and how accessible materials have been used by marginalized folks to self publish and get their voice heard for over a century. Express what's important to you in your own zine to take with you!\n\nNo experience necessary, all supplies provided.",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We will continue to fight for our children, for each other’s children, and for all future generations. \n\nCome celebrate these kids!  Let’s lift them up, and show them how many people believe in them and want the best for them. Let’s listen to them speak. They see more than we could know, and they know more than we think.  It’s time to hand them the mic.\n\nSome Notes:\n\n• The only speakers we will have at this event are children (under 18) and those who work directly with children.\n\nOur lineup will look a bit different.\n\n• We are planning to have an ‘Under 18 Open Mic’ session. Your kid can sign up at the DJ booth.\n\n• VERY IMPORTANT: Please...Mind your signs. Let’s keep this a PG event! Thanks!\n\nJoin our NH 50501 Facebook: Group:https://www.facebook.com/groups/2129766790803823/?ref=share&mibextid=NSMWBT\n\nFor more information & RSVP to this event See NH 50501 Event on Facebook: \n\nhttps://facebook.com/events/s/no-voice-too-small/713763534524281/",

Expect a circus!\n\nFriday, June 13th, join us at Roosevelt Park for an anti-Trump, community-led teach-in and mock parade.\n\nJune 13th happens to be the 54th anniversary of a rebellion against police brutality that famously took place in Roosevelt Park on June 13, 1971. It goes that, “a young Chicano man was reportedly arrested for selling a joint to an undercover narcotics agent. As the situation escalated the Black Berets, a Chicano community organization, were called in.\n\nThe Berets tried to move people out of the park and speak with police, but were fired upon. This blew up into a riot fueled by decades of racism and police abuse against Albuquerque’s Chicano community. Eventually, the National Guard was brought in.”\n\n…The National Guard is once again being brought in to occupy our streets and neighborhoods. As Trump prepares his own dictator-style military parade, we the people of New Mexico, are here to remind this administration that we stand united against tyranny, fascism, and racism.\n\nTeach-in 5:30PM\nMarch starts 6PM\n\nGather on the north side of the park by Coal.

    "description": "The chaos fueled by Trump’s authoritarian ambitions and Musk’s reckless influence can make the future feel bleak. But we’re not powerless and the numbers show just how close we are to taking back control. \n\nIn 2024, Democrats lost the House by 3 seats and just 7,309 votes total—the narrowest House majority in almost 100 years. \n\n**With such a narrow margin, winning the House is doable.** And it’s also the most impactful thing we can do to halt the destructive Trump, Musk, and Project 2025 agenda. While calling Congress and supporting lawsuits help to slow the bleeding, only elections will remove them from office. A House victory will give Democrats a critical federal lever: more power and more oversight to investigate government actions and political corruption, effectively stopping the MAGA legislative agenda in its tracks.\n\nWorking together, we can take a critical first step toward rebuilding democracy. **Join our gathering to connect, commiserate, and conspire– we’ll learn more about Swing Left’s strategy and make a plan to take action together.**",

Together, we’ll explore how to:\n\n✅ Advocate for smaller class sizes and enforce existing laws\n✅ Demand funding for science, ESE, and school-based staff\n✅ Push back on universal vouchers and privatization efforts\n✅ Uplift teachers through fair pay, mental health support, and workplace protections\n✅ Build stronger partnerships between families, educators, and local decision-makers\n✅ Challenge harmful policies at the ballot box and in Tallahassee\n\nLet’s build momentum, craft strategy, and take collective action to create schools where every child—and every educator—can thrive.\n\n🎟️ Register now and zoom link will be sent to you. \n📢 Brought to you by Families for Strong Public Schools, Hillsborough Classroom Teachers Association and Florida Policy Institute",

    "description": "In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings. NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",

There is a drop off section where people hold their signs. There should be a ramp there. If you want to get as close as possible, there is an option to turn left on the side of Roundhouse/State Capitol and you can pull up to the curb at the crosswalk where a ramp is located.\n\nThere is also an accessible entrance to the Roundhouse/State Capitol through \"Capitol North\" on Don Gaspar Avenue (the one-way street). Follow the blue accessibility signs to the ramp and to the accessible entrance. This option will not accommodate someone with limited mobility who needs direct access and requires a shorter distance.\n\nPhysical Address: 490 Old Santa Fe Trail, Santa Fe, NM 87501\nFree parking is available Monday through Friday at 420 Galisteo St.\n\nHelpful links:\nhttps://santafe.com/getting-here/ \nhttps://www.nmlegis.gov/visitors",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Attending a postcard-writing meeting like ours is a powerful and personal way to help strengthen our democracy. We want to understand why some voters sat out the 2024 general election. We want to know whether they felt unheard, frustrated, or disconnected from the political process. Reaching out to them directly through a handwritten message can remind them that their voice matters and that their participation is essential. When people feel seen and valued, they’re more likely to re-engage.\n\nWe can’t keep New Jersey blue without full voter turnout. These meetings are about more than just writing postcards... they’re about building community, fostering connection, and taking real steps to combat voter apathy. By joining us, you’re helping deliver a message of hope and urgency one voter at a time.\n\nLet’s remind our neighbors that the fight isn’t over and that every vote has the power to shape the future. Thank you!",

These practices destroy trust in law enforcement and threaten public safety. \n\nJoin us in alliance with the New Virginia Majority Solidarity Committee at the next Loudoun County Board of Supervisors meeting to speak out against Sheriff Chapman’s anti-immigrant policies.\n\nLoudoun residents should sign up to speak. Starting this Friday you can call 703-777-0200 to sign up in advance. Non-Loudoun residents are welcome to join in solidarity. Please join us in support of our community members by signing up! Wear a green shirt to show solidarity!\n\nIf you can't make it, email the Loudoun Board of Supervisors to let them know what you think about Sheriff Chapman's policies: bos@loudoun.gov.",

Yet too many of our elected officials in Trenton lack the political courage to meet the urgency of this moment.\n\nFor too long, unelected party bosses and the polluter interests they represent have controlled our state climate and energy policies, stymying progress at every turn. By building a progressive caucus of legislators who are primarily accountable to voters and not special interests, we can win the change we need to protect our health, address New Jersey’s affordability crisis, and invest in our communities.\n\nSign up and we'll send you a batch of texts to send out to urge voters to support climate champions in the upcoming primary election on June 10.

In true “midnight special” fashion on May 6th, Rep. Mark Amodei quietly pushed a plan to auction off  449,174 acres of Nevada’s public lands—the largest proposed giveaway in state history. And the kicker? The money wouldn’t even stay in Nevada. Instead, it’d be funneled to the U.S. Treasury to help pay for Trump’s tax cuts. Apparently, “representing the people” now means selling off their land behi\n\n🦺 PLEASE NOTE: INNV supports non-violent participation in civic events.

    "description": "This a local Indivisible event. \n\nRise with us in Florence for Indivisible’s nationwide No Kings! Mass Protest to make clear that under the U.S. Constitution the People Have the Power and we won’t let an abusive and corrupt would-be king sell us out and rob us blind.\n\nThe guy who wants a palace in the sky wants to take away our health care and rip away the social safety net that millions—-valiant veterans, tiny infants, hungry kids, workers down on their luck, and seniors who need a helping hand these days after spending lifetimes in service to others—depend on for their survival. \n\nTo would-be kings we say: No Abductions! No Bribes! No Usurpation of Human Rights!\n\nInstead the people affirm we want:  Peace and Prosperity. Greater Access to Economic Success. A Quality Education. Affordable Health Care. Breathable Air. Water Safe Enough to Drink. Economic Stability and Growth for All. \n\nEnough with the Crazy and Corrupt!\n\nWe will be staging our protest along the east side of Highway 101, from Peace Corner (Hwys. 101/126) to Florence City Hall (the Bridge). Our message is “We the People! No Kings!” We have cause to oppose the overreach of a would-be authoritarian and his regime. We have a strong case to demand better for ourselves—our neighbors, families, children, grandchildren, our planet!—all of it spelled out clearly in the Bill of Rights and U.S. Constitution. There will be a better day and we will hold accountable those who violate their oaths of office, ignore the courts, scoff at the law, and take from folks living day-to-day on what they can barely scrape together, all to further add to their enormous fortunes.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.",

    "description": "### Join us for a training and brainstorm session about how to build our team in Caledonia! \n\nIn 2026, we have a huge opportunity to flip State Senate District 21—one of the **most competitive** districts in the entire state! Under current Republican leadership, the state legislature has rejected expanding Medicaid, slashed public education funding, and restricted access to reproductive health care. But we can change that. \n\nIf we start building up our volunteer team and connecting with voters this summer, we’ll have the power we need to flip this district next year. We can decide control of the Wisconsin State Senate and elect Democrats who will protect our health care, invest in public education, and stand up for reproductive freedom.\n\nDuring this event, we'll learn share effective strategies for reaching out to voters and potential volunteers in our community and discuss your ideas for building our team!",
