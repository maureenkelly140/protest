    "description": "ALL OUR ACTIONS WILL BE PEACEFUL AND RESPECTFUL!!!\n\nThe last few years in America have seen a record number of bills that attack LGBTQIA+ rights, and now the attack from Trump is targeting transgender military members.\nAccording to USA Today, \"The Supreme Court has ruled against transgender people serving in the military, legitimizing President Donald Trump's discriminatory agenda.\nOn May 6, the nation's highest court decided to allow Trump’s trans military ban to take effect after a lower court had halted its enforcement. Because the decision was part of the “shadow docket” ‒ emergency appeals decided without full briefing or oral argument, and without any written opinion ‒ we don’t know why the justices ruled this way or how the vote was divided, although the three liberal judges on the court say they would have rejected the request that the case be heard.\" https://www.usatoday.com/.../supreme-court.../83499410007/ .\n\nJoin us at the Williamsburg James City County Courthouse, located at 5201 Monticello Avenue, Williamsburg, Virginia, on Friday, June 6th, at NOON to show our support for the LGBTQIA+ Community. It will be hot so please bring a cold beverage, a chair if needed, and take heat precautions, such as a hat or umbrella, etc...\n\nLOVE IS LOVE - SHOW YOUR PRIDE!!!\n\nAs with our previous events, the same rules apply. We will not engage with counter-protesters. If an issue arises, please notify one of the event organizers, who will be wearing Williamsburg JCC Indivisible t-shirts. We will not engage in any acts of violence or violation of any applicable laws or engage in civil disobedience. All actions will be peaceful. Everyone participating in this event will be required to behave lawfully to ensure the safety of event participants and will seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. We will obey the orders of authorized event marshals and law enforcement authorities. Event organizers will not be responsible for any injury or damage if any were to occur during this event. We will park in the Courthouse parking lot without blocking access lanes and will remove any trash that is left. We are committed to maintaining public health measures to practice safe protesting during these times. Please wear a mask and socially distance if that makes you more comfortable - weigh your own risk in attending. Follow all local safety guidelines at minimum, and any safety instructions from hosts that exceed local law.",

    "description": "When injustice, threats of political violence, and uncertainty about the future feel overwhelming, history reminds us that we are not powerless. We carry a legacy of proven tools, tactics, and collective courage from past movements like ours that can defend democracy and rekindle hope for a bright future.\n\nThis month, we’re partnering with Pramila Jayapal’s Resistance Lab, taking stock of these tools, and getting organized. Join us for MomsRising's May Community Zoom: Resistance Lab on **Thursday, May 22nd, 8:30 pm ET/ 5:30 pm PT,** where we’ll break down how to build the resistance we need.\n\nAnd the resistance starts with you! Moms and caregivers do the work of organizing everyday, whether we know it or not. We hold the worries about the present and the hope for the future, all while keeping on with caring for and loving on our children and communities. \n\nIf ever we needed a resistance movement full of moms and caregivers, it is now. Will you join us?",

    "description": "Join MomsRising and Advancement Project for a VIRTUAL Teach-In on Supporting Immigrant Students and Families in Hostile School Environments. \n\nIn today’s polarized political climate, supporting immigrant students in public schools is more critical than ever. As national debates around immigration grow increasingly heated, schools, which should be sanctuaries of learning and belonging, can unintentionally mirror the hostility, fear, and discrimination seen in broader society. Without intentional collective efforts to support immigrant students and families, bias, harmful policies and practices, and a lack of cultural understanding can create environments where immigrant students feel unsafe, unseen, and excluded. Left unchecked, these hostile conditions not only harm students’ academic achievement and mental health but also weaken the fabric of school communities.\n\nIt will take all of us actively fostering inclusive, affirming spaces, in our schools and communities to counteract division, uphold the principles of dignity and opportunity, and ensure that every student, regardless of birthplace or status, has the chance to thrive, lead, and contribute to a stronger, more equitable future for us all because to be honest we are better together.\n\n\nWe can’t wait to share space with you. Don’t forget to RSVP to join and receive event updates including a post event resource guide. \n\nJoin us virtually on Tuesday, June 10th at 6 PM CST / 7 PM EST.",

Hear from a few advocates and local faith leaders, and bring a donation (nonperishable food item or a monetary donation) for a local food bank if you’re able! \nThe Luzerne County Chapter meeting will begin immediately following the social hour at 6pm.**\n\nFamilies and communities look out for one another. From our schools and healthcare providers to local organizations, we all strive to ensure that everyone not only gets by—but has the chance to thrive. That responsibility includes our elected officials.\n\nRight now, Congress is moving quickly on a reconciliation package that could gut vital safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP, shifting the burden to states and local communities. These cuts would endanger families, strain local budgets, and jeopardize Pennsylvania’s ability to meet basic needs—all to pay for tax breaks for billionaires.\n\nWe call on Representative Rob Bresnahan to honor his commitment to protect Medicaid and SNAP. The Republican-proposed cuts could strip healthcare from hundreds of thousands of people in our region and take food off the tables of families across the 8th District—all to benefit the ultra-wealthy.\n\n**Doors will open at 4:30pm, and we'll have plenty of tacos and other goodies for all!**",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

Feel free to wear a costume too.  Recently, SpongeBob showed up as well as a professional balloon artist.  Also, if you have them, bring your drums, cowbells, whistles, saxophones, tubas, tambourines and any other musical instruments to help add to the fun!",
