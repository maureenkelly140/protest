This friendly presence ensures that voters feel supported and informed as they exercise their right to vote.\n\nIn local elections, where outcomes can hinge on a small number of votes, the role of poll greeters is crucial in maximizing voter turnout and ensuring a smooth voting experience.\n\nNever poll greeted before? Don't worry, this training will provide you with the information and tools you need to be an effective poll greeter on Election Day.\n\nWhy is Poll Greeting Important?\n\n- Voter Assistance: Poll greeters can answer last-minute questions, direct voters to the correct polling locations, and provide information on voting procedures, reducing confusion and wait times.\n\n- Encouragement: A warm welcome can boost voter morale and reinforce the importance of their participation in the democratic process.\n\n- Education: Poll greeters help ensure voters are informed about their choices before entering the polling place by distributing sample ballots and information about candidates or issues.\n\n**Facilited by Lancaster City Dems for all Lancaster County Democratic Poll Greeters.",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego.

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Rally to Defend our Social Safety Net-\n\nWebsite: www.SaveSocialSecurity.Net\n\nRally to Save Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid – May 7 at 4 PM in West Chester, PA\nWEST CHESTER, PA — Concerned citizens of Chester County will gather at 4 PM on Wednesday, May 7 at the Social Security Office, to demand an end to the systematic dismantling of America’s most vital safety net programs: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n\nThe rally, organized by SaveSocialSecurity.Net, aims to draw attention to sweeping changes taking place under President Trump’s administration — many of which are being implemented without public debate and in ways that disproportionately harm seniors, the disabled, and low-income Americans.\n\nChaos by Design: Undermining the Social Security Administration\nIn just the first 100 days of Trump’s return to office, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has faced:\n\nStricter ID verification rules, revised three times in a single month\n\nOffice closures and massive staff reductions, with over 2,500 experienced employees taking buyouts\n\nPlanned cuts of 12% of SSA’s workforce, totaling nearly 7,000 jobs\n\nLoss of institutional knowledge, which is critical to resolving complex claims\n\nReduced access to in-person and telephone services, forcing online-only interaction\n\nThese actions are justified as efforts to reduce fraud, despite no evidence of widespread abuse and SSA’s long-standing reputation as one of the most efficiently run federal agencies.\n\n“This isn’t reform — it’s sabotage,” said Cynthia Sherbin, an advisor with SaveSocialSecurity.Net. “The real goal is to create frustration and dysfunction so privatization seems like the only solution.”\n\nPrivatization: A Corporate Boondoggle\nAs with Medicare Advantage, privatization would shift services into the hands of for-profit corporations, introducing:\n\nHigher administrative costs\n\nGreater risk and market exposure for retirees\n\nIncreased potential for fraud, not less\n\n“Privatizing Social Security doesn’t fix the system — it feeds corporate greed,” Sherbin said. “It redirects guaranteed benefits into the hands of shareholders, while increasing bureaucracy and decreasing reliability.”\n\nSolvency Myths and Real Solutions\nMuch of the fear-mongering about Social Security’s future ignores straightforward solutions. In 2025, only the first $176,100 of earned income is subject to Social Security tax, and passive income like stock dividends goes untaxed. By simply:\n\nRaising the income cap  \n\nOR\n\nIncluding passive income of the wealthiest Americans, also known as (AKA) Billionaires!\n\n...Social Security's long-term solvency can be secured without cutting a single benefit.\n\nMedicaid in the Crosshairs\nThe third pillar of the safety net — Medicaid — is under attack as well. The latest House-passed budget includes an $880 billion cut to Medicaid, jeopardizing care for:\n\n63% of nursing home residents\n\n42% of all U.S. births\n\nMillions of disabled and low-income Americans, including 37 million children in the U.S. are enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP\n\n“These devastating cuts are not about reducing waste — they’re about making room for more tax breaks for the rich,” Sherbin said.\n\nJoin the Rally – May 7 at 4 PM\nWhat: Rally to Save Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid\nWhen: Wednesday, May 7, 2025 | 4:00 PM\nWhere: Social Security Office, West Chester, PA\n\nConcerned citizens, advocates, and community leaders are invited to attend and demand that these lifeline programs be protected — not gutted.\n\n#SaveSocialSecurity #ProtectMedicare #DefendMedicaidFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nMay 7, 2025\nContact: Cynthia Sherbin | info@SaveSocialSecurity.Net",

This campaign seeks to codify access to gender affirming care, reproductive healthcare, and marriage equality into the Oregon constitution. \n\nER4A gives Oregon voters a chance to enshrine these values. We need to gather over 250,000 signatures to get on the ballot in 2026. Joining us at pride this year is a chance to celebrate and advocate for a better Oregon.\n\nWe will be collecting signatures, sharing our work, and giving away goodies to all who stop by our booth. \n\nWe hope you'll join us!

We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

He’s one of the first major candidates to respond to our outreach — and he’s making time to speak with grassroots groups like ours directly.\n\nThis is not an endorsement — it’s a chance to ask real questions and hear directly from someone who wants to lead New Jersey.\n\n🗣️ If you care about the future of our state, we hope you’ll join us for this important conversation.",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking  action nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

In addition, The White House has recently announced they will be doing a HUGE military parade this day. This is something Trump asked for during his previous term, but the military officials refused to allow 1) millions of dollars to be spent on the parade 2) to disrupt the military in order to participate in a parade. This time around, he will get his parade. On this day, we will not be silent in Ketchikan. We will join the nation to protest Trump’s desire to be treated as a king.

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

Four of those will face opponents in the Democratic primary in June: Iris Packman, Irene Weiser, Billy Noseworthy and Hannah Shvets. These four have all agreed to speak on May 18th, and other candidates will also be given an opportunity at the mic.\n\nAttendees will also hear from WFP leaders about the club's plans for the coming months, and will have the opportunity to volunteer for any of our endorsed candidates.\n\nSuggested donation at the door is $10-$50 (student price through supporter price). All proceeds will go the the New York WFP organization, which will be providing services and support for our candidates. Attendees are also welcome to donate directly to the candidates of their choice, at the event or before or after.\n\nLive music and food and beverages will be supplied by WFP. (The Argos Warehouse bar will not be staffed, however, which means ID will not be checked at the door, so feel free to bring your family.)",

Committed and reliable. Ready to set aside ordinary things.\n\nIf you’re possibly interested in becoming part of the core team, reach out, check us out. We get that becoming a core walker is a dive-in decision, so it's probably best if you get a feel for who we are and what we are doing to make the core group a team that’s happily, totally into it. Accommodations and meals will be on a sliding-scale for this group, as we desire to have a diverse group joining us. If you cannot make the whole walk due to other obligations please don't let that stop you from inquiring.\n\n​\n\nWe hope that our walk will inspire and support local creativity, community, and peaceful resistance, all along the way.\nThis is how our march becomes your march, and actually, it’s sort of like everyone’s march.\n\nSo many concerned citizens are already creating and connecting in peaceful, resolute resistance, and it's already making a difference...\n\nLet's keep on keeping on.\n\nCheck out our website www.democracy12.com. We hope to see you soon!\n\nLet's vote like Australia!  Use voterizer in any state to register or re-register voters for the next election.",

And they're making the cuts to give huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.\n\nMany hospitals around the state could lose major funding. Mercy Hospital could lose millions of dollars.  The proposed cuts would mean devastating cutbacks in services and longer wait times - even for people who have private insurance.  \n\nTo stop the cuts and save lives we need to get a handful of Republican Congressmembers to vote NO on the proposed healthcare cuts.  We'll be rallying to save Mercy Hospital in Folsom on Tuesday, May 13th at 11:30 AM with doctors, nurses, other healthcare providers and community supporters to call on Congressman Kevin Kiley to vote NO on any cuts to Medicaid!",

We have been in contact with the film’s producers and may have the opportunity to host a post-screening Q&A or discussion on the real-world application of these ideas in politics with individuals involved in the film.\n\nPlease RSVP to help us assess interest, communicate with the film’s producers, and secure the necessary screening kit and resources.\n\nJoin us for an evening of engaging discussion, learning, and community conversation. All are welcome!",

We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*\n\nWe have **NO KINGS** here in America. And, _*we won't tolerate*_ a president who acts like one. So, join us at Alameda City Hall on Saturday June 14th from 12 noon till 1 PM to make our voices heard.\n\nAlso, we will have a food donation bin at the protest site in support of our neighbors in need. Please bring non-perishable food items for donation. Every little bit helps!

Their ultimate goal – highlighted in their Project 2025 manifesto – is the destruction of church-state separation, inclusive religious freedom, LGBTQ+ and women’s rights, inclusive public schools and more… all while enshrining their narrow, religious beliefs into law for us to suffer under.\n\nFinanced by the secretive Council for National Policy, the movement has succeeded in infiltrating American politics and has become one of the most powerful political forces in the nation. Discover the origins of this organized grasp for power, and learn about the grassroots coalition of secular and interfaith leaders who are bravely confronting the grave threat Christian Nationalism poses to our democracy.",

    "description": "The City of Stonecrest is celebrating Juneteenth bigger than ever before this year by hosting it's 3rd annual Juneteenth Celebration of Freedom on Saturday June 14, 2025.\n\nDeKalb Dems will have a visibility tent and we need volunteers to assist with set up and act as Ambassadors who listen to citizen's concerns, offer ways we can support them, and talk about what they can do to safeguard our freedom.\n\nJuneteenth commemorates the effective end of slavery in the United States. Two years after President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, news reached Texas and, upon learning they were free, former slaves immediately began celebrating with prayer, feasting, song, and dance. The Juneteenth Celebration of Freedom will celebrate African American culture, heritage, and, most importantly, abolishment of slavery.\n\nThe Juneteenth Celebration of Freedom will feature an expanded kidz zone, live performances, food trucks, vendors, and fireworks show. It is a place for all races, nationalities, and religions to join hands and truthfully acknowledge a period in history that shaped and continues to influence our society today, according to a news release. This event is free and open to the public, and we encourage everyone to attend and learn more about the history and culture of Juneteenth!\n\nPlease sign up for a shift below and be a part of this Celebration of Freedom.",

The fight for justice is long—and if we’re going to stay in it, we need space to move, breathe, speak, and be heard.\n\nCome out, bring your family, move your body, and let your voice be heard!

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "**Now’s the Time: Bring Lit & Liberty to Your Community**\n\nOur democracy is being dismantled—and we need more spaces where truth, dialogue, and bold ideas can thrive. Lit & Liberty is building those spaces through a nationwide network of book clubs, and now we’re calling on everyday leaders like YOU to start a chapter in your own town.\n\nThis 30-minute online session is your chance to take meaningful, doable action. You’ll learn how to spark a local movement for civic engagement and democratic renewal—backed by a full suite of easy-to-use resources, ready-to-go discussion guides, and continued support from the Lit & Liberty team.\n\nYou’ll hear the story behind Lit & Liberty, discover the growing impact of our chapters, and leave empowered to lead one yourself. No experience needed—just a belief in the power of books, films, community, and other powerful stories to awaken minds and drive change.\n\nWhether you're a reader, a teacher, an activist, or simply someone ready to stand up for democracy—this is your moment to step up.\n\nWe need you. Let’s build a national network of truth-seekers and change-makers, one chapter at a time.\n\n📅 You can choose any one of the four times we have scheduled.\n\n📍 Online: https://us04web.zoom.us/j/5161707983?pwd=8yX8arszwZJksQUeYoHvyG8ljOr4sa.1&omn=75539685078",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "The Collin County Democratic Party, in partnership with 50501, invites you to join us as we Stand Up for Democracy! This is a critical moment to raise our voices against the forces threatening our democracy, social security, constitutional rights, and the very foundations of our nation. While this event is sponsored by the Collin County Democratic Party, it is nonpartisan in nature, as we believe ALL Americans must be unified in this fight for our rights.\n\nThis Event WILL go on rain or shine!\n\n### We’re taking a stand against:\n\n- Donald Trump and his MAGA extremists, who continue to undermine free elections and push authoritarian agendas.\n\n- Elon Musk, whose unchecked influence and platforming of far-right extremism endanger our democracy.\n\n- The so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a shadowy effort to dismantle vital government functions.\n\n- All their enablers—corporate greed, voter suppression, attacks on marginalized communities, and the erosion of our civil liberties.\n\n### Why Protest Now? \nOur democracy is under siege. Social Security is at risk. The Constitution is being twisted to serve the powerful. Donald Trump \"doesn't know\" if everyone deserves due process (hint: it's what we're DUE!). Whether it’s attacks on reproductive rights, climate inaction, or the relentless assault on truth and justice—we’ve had enough!\n\nJoin us to demand accountability, defend our freedoms, and fight for a future where democracy works for ALL of us—not just the wealthy and well-connected.\n\n📢 Bring your signs, your anger, and your determination! Together, we will peacefully but assertively make our voices heard.\n\n#StandUpForDemocracy #SaveOurFuture #DefendTheConstitution\n\n📍 Location: Southeast corner of Preston Road and Gaylord Parkway in Frisco, TX. Feel free to park behind the Jared's Jewelers at 3110 Preston Rd, Frisco, TX 75034; we will congregate on the sidewalk on the SE corner of Preston and Gaylord.\n\n📅 Date & Time: May 17th, 2025 9-11am\n\nThis is OUR democracy. Let’s fight for it! ✊",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego.

We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",
