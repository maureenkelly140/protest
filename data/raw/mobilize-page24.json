The fight for justice is long‚Äîand if we‚Äôre going to stay in it, we need space to move, breathe, speak, and be heard.\n\nCome out, bring your family, move your body, and let your voice be heard!

This is a critical moment to raise our voices against the forces threatening our democracy, social security, constitutional rights, and the very foundations of our nation. While this event is sponsored by the Collin County Democratic Party, it is nonpartisan in nature, as we believe ALL Americans must be unified in this fight for our rights.\n\nThis Event WILL go on rain or shine!\n\n### We‚Äôre taking a stand against:\n\n- Donald Trump and his MAGA extremists, who continue to undermine free elections and push authoritarian agendas.\n\n- Elon Musk, whose unchecked influence and platforming of far-right extremism endanger our democracy.\n\n- The so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a shadowy effort to dismantle vital government functions.\n\n- All their enablers‚Äîcorporate greed, voter suppression, attacks on marginalized communities, and the erosion of our civil liberties.\n\n### Why Protest Now? \nOur democracy is under siege. Social Security is at risk. The Constitution is being twisted to serve the powerful. Donald Trump \"doesn't know\" if everyone deserves due process (hint: it's what we're DUE!). Whether it‚Äôs attacks on reproductive rights, climate inaction, or the relentless assault on truth and justice‚Äîwe‚Äôve had enough!\n\nJoin us to demand accountability, defend our freedoms, and fight for a future where democracy works for ALL of us‚Äînot just the wealthy and well-connected.\n\nüì¢ Bring your signs, your anger, and your determination! Together, we will peacefully but assertively make our voices heard.\n\n#StandUpForDemocracy #SaveOurFuture #DefendTheConstitution\n\nüìç Location: Southeast corner of Preston Road and Gaylord Parkway in Frisco, TX. Feel free to park behind the Jared's Jewelers at 3110 Preston Rd, Frisco, TX 75034; we will congregate on the sidewalk on the SE corner of Preston and Gaylord.\n\nüìÖ Date & Time: May 17th, 2025 9-11am\n\nThis is OUR democracy.

    "description": "Everyone should have the right to run ‚Äì and come to the voter as they are. This Pride Month, join us to explore what it means to run for office if you are an LGBTQ+ leader in the making.¬†\n\n  \n\nBeing out and running for office can feel especially challenging right now. But it‚Äôs also why this training can be especially important. Acceptance, representation, a voice at the table, and the protection of our rights all work in tandem. Representation is how we got to a Supreme Court decision about marriage equality.

    "description": "**In America, we don‚Äôt put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We‚Äôve watched as they‚Äôve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They‚Äôve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\nüö®**On Saturday, June 14, we‚Äôre taking to the streets nationwide. We‚Äôre not gathering to feed his ego. We‚Äôre building a movement that leaves him behind.**üö®\n\n\nThe flag doesn‚Äôt belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We‚Äôre not watching history happen. We‚Äôre making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we‚Äôre showing up everywhere he isn‚Äôt‚Äîto say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*\n\nWe will rally in Rose Hill Park at 4pm and March through Berryville, returning to the park at 6pm.  Be prepared to march and shout!\n\nBring signs and banners, emphasizing-\nNo Tyrants!\nNo Kings!\nNo Oligarchs!",

This day is for anyone who believes that no one‚Äîno matter how powerful‚Äîshould be treated like royalty in a nation built on liberty.\n\nWe‚Äôre gathering not in anger, but in unity. This is a space for reflection, connection, and a shared commitment to a country where leaders serve, not rule. Whether you're conservative, progressive, independent, or politically unsure‚Äîif you believe in the idea of a government by and for the people, this rally is for you.\n\nThis is a peaceful, de-escalation-focused event. There is no place here for violence, intimidation, or hate. We welcome calm, respectful voices who want to help shape a future rooted in mutual respect and civic responsibility.\n\nBring your signs, your friends, your conscience‚Äîand your belief that the United States was never meant to have kings.",

We will feature speakers who are themselves veterans, who will speak on history, duty, honor, sacrifice, and patriotism. We will conduct a wreath-laying ceremony at the Soldiers and Sailors Monument on the Boston Common featuring patriotic renditions of ‚ÄúTaps,‚Äù ‚ÄúBattle Hymn of the Republic,‚Äù and other songs. We will protest cuts to the VA, oppose the undemocratic way in which the administration has treated its duties, reaffirm our support for our allies, and recommit ourselves to the principles that have governed the nation and its military for centuries, and we will remind the people that veterans and active duty military personnel exist to protect the nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic. It will be both a protest and a solemn event of remembrance. \n\n## Event Program\n\n## Act 1: Invocation of Service\nAn honor guard procession will bear American, State, and Service flags from the Soldiers and Sailors Monument to the stage, followed by an invocation and remarks from the Program Director. \n\n## Act 2: The Citizen Soldier\nWe'll hear from ordinary citizens‚Äîveterans and those who support them‚Äîaddressing the issues that matter to veterans today.\n\n## Act 3: A Call to Duty\nVIP speakers will offer stories to help draw us together, and remind us that the bonds of service do not end upon separation from the military and that participation in our democracy is essential to its health and prosperity.\n\n## Act 4: Honor the Fallen\nThe honor guard and key speakers will process back to the Soldiers and Sailors Monument to lay a wreath, followed by Taps, a moment of silence, and closing words. \n\n# Flags are welcome, but please leave protest signs at home.",

Trump‚Äôs tacky parade was inspired by dictators he idolizes, and will cost taxpayers nearly $100 million. \n\nOrganizer and strategist Daniel Hunter has written that ‚ÄúHumor is important for our psyches ‚Äî and to take fascists down a notch[‚Ä¶] Humor is key for morale and exposing the vulnerability of the strongman image.‚Äù This is where the ridiculous meets the resistance‚Äîand where the future is on the line.\n\nJune 14 is our chance to reflect the absurdity of the MAGA regime and the clowns who lead it. To meet this moment, Women‚Äôs March will host community circuses nationwide‚Äîbold, creative actions that mirror the chaos MAGA has sown across the country. Together, we‚Äôll set a national record for the most circuses held in a single day while we simultaneously refuse to celebrate a petty clown who desperately wants to be seen as strong. We won‚Äôt stop until we build the country we all deserve.\n`\nOur grassroots street circuses turn satire into resistance and reclaim the big tent for democracy.\n\n#KickOutTheClowns\n#GreatestShitshowOnEarth\n#CommunitiesNotClowns\n#ClownsAgainstClowns \n#BigTentResistance",

    "description": "Join us for a social speaker series dedicated to learning about Rhode Island government in a friendly, casual environment. Come meet other civic-curious people, and walk away with a tool box of direct actions you can take to make meaningful change in your local community. And maybe make some new friends! \n\nThis event will focus specifically on state, city and town budgets. Expert speakers will present an overview of how a budget is drafted, approved and implemented. They will also discuss specific actions non-elected citizens can take to participate in the process and influence the money that flows back into their communities. Future monthly Rhody Civics Club events will focus on topics such as an overview of the state legislature, how a bill becomes law, housing justice, and how to run an election, among others. \n\nSmall bites will be provided, as well as a full self-pay bar. This event is open to under 21, and the bar will be checking ID. Spend some time chatting with other attendees and building new connections, before transitioning to listening to the expert speakers. There will be a Q&A session at the end. \n\nAll are welcome! Anyone interested in getting more involved in our government is invited. Together we can make democracy what it was always supposed to be: of the people, by the people, for the people.\n\nThis event is sponsored by the Rhode Island Working Families Party.",

We expect big lines and lots of locals so it will be a great place to collect vouchers.\n\nFeel free to fit the vibe with your attire and come engage people before the movie. Regular voucher collectors will jump at the chance to see a lot of Seattleites waiting in one place. \n\nWe'll connect with you beforehand to make sure you're ready. Someone will meet you there with the materials you need to spend an hour to 90-minutes collecting vouchers for Nathan!\n\nSee you there!",
