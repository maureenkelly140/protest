We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

But SoCal families are stuck breathing some of the dirtiest air in the country, causing asthma, illness, and even early death.\n\nThis doesn't have to be our reality. We can ditch the dangerous gas appliances and switch to safer electric alternatives. \n\nOur local air regulators are voting on rules that could change that by giving you the option to choose a healthier, gas-free home.\n\nThe gas industry is pushing back and fighting to keep electric options off store shelves. Why? Profit over people. \n\nLet's make sure they hear us, not gas industry lobbying. Join us on June 6th to demand clean air and healthy homes!\n\nPlease join us— we need you there to clean the air!\n\n📅 Join us to rally for clean air on Friday, June 6 at 8 a.m.\n\nAfter the rally, you can comment at the 9 a.m. SCAQMD board meeting to tell the board: Pass strong rules, no more delays, no more weakening and why you care.",

The committee needs your help making this year's drive successful. Please ask people in your network to donate blood and consider volunteering to help the day of the event.\n\t\t\nThe committee has a limited number of time slots; if you wish to donate, sign up online. Thank you for considering giving the gift of life with your blood donation.

    "description": "In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.\n\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t — to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.\n\nJoin us at the intersection of Olde Waterford Way and Route 17 Southbound (400–448 Olde Waterford Way, Leland, NC 28451) between the hours of 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM on Saturday June 14th. Please park in the public parking areas near Harris Teeter just behind the intersection.\n\nThis is considered a \"stationary march\" where you will stand on the grass just off Route 17 at Olde Waterford Way and the traffic will pass you by. Your job is to be visible. Make yourself be seen. Our aim is to be respectful, safe and considerate of motorists passing us by. There will be representatives from the 2 sponsoring organizations – Indivisible Defenders of Democracy and Indivisible Wilmington.\n\nCome prepared. Bring a backpack with food and water, sunscreen, sunglasses, a hat and an umbrella in case of rain or to block the sun. Bring a chair too to sit a spell when you get tired. And of course bring a sign to let motorists know how you feel. The theme is No Kings.\n\nINDIVISIBLE DEFENDERS OF DEMOCRACY\n\nINDIVISIBLE WILMINGTON\n\nBRUNSWICK INDIVISIBLE STEPPING FORWARD FOR ACTION",

    "description": "You are an amazing group! All heroes in our eyes! We have news about TWO events! Yes TWO! So read carefully! The site and time will be the same, the dates will be different. So on Saturday May 31st we will gather at 147th and the East side of LaGrange Road in Orland Park at 11am until 1pm. This is a peaceful protest. Please do not engage with any counter protesters.  Some do not like this approach but we have found it to be the most successful way of having our voices heard and enjoying the community we have developed. There will be monitors on site if a de-escalation is needed.  On Saturday the 14th of June we will gather at the above mentioned place and same time for NO KINGS DAY. We know there are bigger venues but feel that some of our  most vulnerable that cannot make those trips have the same opportunity as everyone. We get people from nearby and far away! We post on many platforms so we do draw a great mix of people! On some platforms we are South Suburban Relentless and also Protect Our Rights.  Our last protest had a head count of over 100 and I heard one of our group say there were 150 supporters of OUR RGHTS that attended! Ten, Fifty or Hundreds, we are all fighting the good fight and on the right side of history.  As always bring a chair if you need a break. Bring water and friends! See you there!

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies. They think they rule—but we are bigger than even their worst aspirations.\n• Donald Trump is planning a military parade in Washington, D.C. on June 14. This display of might is intended to intimidate opponents and solidify his image as a strongman on our dime—we won’t stand by while that happens.\n• Instead of allowing this military parade to be the center of gravity, we will make action everywhere else the story of America that day: people coming together in communities across the country to reject strongman politics and corruption.\n• Alongside local organizers, partners, and leaders from across the pro-democracy & pro-worker movement, we will demonstrate organized people power that outpaces any authoritarian aspirations.",

And they're making the cuts to give huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.\n\nTo stop the cuts and save lives we need to get a handful of Republican Congressmembers to vote NO on the proposed healthcare cuts.  \n\nJoin us on Thursday, May 20th at 10 AM for a funeral procession to Congressman Valadao's office to demonstrate what these cuts will mean.",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We will not engage with counter-protesters. If an issue arises, please notify one of the event organizers, who will be wearing Williamsburg JCC Indivisible t-shirts.

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

    "description": "This a local Indivisible event!\nProtest to Support our LGBTQ+ Community\n\nDate: Sunday, June 22nd \nTime: 4:00PM-5:30PM\nLocation: Hyannis Airport Rotary (details about parking and where exactly to stand listed below.) \nPlease wear “pride spirit” to make a visual impact as a rainbow sea of love, acceptance, and appreciation for diversity and all the unique talents that makes our community so vibrant. \nAs always, please bring signs, flags, drums, other instruments, chants, art, etc., as joy is resistance, art is resistance, community is resistance. [Joyful community resistance to fascism]\n\nIn honor/celebration of pride month, we are protesting against Trump & his administration, specifically against the harm he has caused to the LGBTQ+ community. We are infuriated with his executive orders that ban gender affirming care for minors, that restrict trans rights, and that eliminate protections against discrimination for those in the LGBTQ+ community. We recognize the detrimental effect this has had on the well being of many individuals and the community as a whole. We stand in solidarity to say we will not put up with this.\nWe will not allow this administration’s attacks on the LGBTQ+ community to continue! #RESIST\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n******Corruption destroys, Community Builds: We will also be collecting nonperishable food items for the AIDS support group in Hyannis. ******\n\nWe are being cosponsored by a local pride group, and have invited local pride groups to set up informational tables if they are available. \n\nAs with every protest, we also want to highlight the extreme unconstitutional practices of this administration, as this is not just about policies. \nThis is NOT business as usual in DC, this is NOT normal. \n\nThis republican administration has attempted to seize control over state election processes through executive orders and efforts to undermine civil rights legislation, as well as threatening the checks and balances established by the Constitution, such as disregarding court orders and altering federal regulations without proper authority.​​ The administration is using its current power to help billionaires continue to profit while striping away the services that help the most needy. \n\nWe need to stand up for due process, free speech, upholding court rulings, and the separation of church and state. The Founding Fathers established the principles of due process, free speech, and the separation of church and state through the First Amendment and other parts of the Constitution. These concepts were designed to protect individual rights and limit government power. \nWe have NO KINGS in America, yet Trump is acting like one. \nWe, the people, must rise up, and show that the power of the people is greater than the people in power. \n\nProtest Homework (aka, protest action steps)\n5 Calls App or Website, National Action Steps:\nScroll down to the LGBTQ+ section, as of right now there are 2 calls to make (to all 3 of your members of congress!):\n1. *“condemn RFK Jr’s False Report on Transgender Youth Treatment” and \n2. *“Oppose Efforts to Dehumanize transgender and LGBTQ+ people” \nIf you have time for another round of calls, please scroll to “executive overreach” and click:\n3. *”fight the trump administration’s defiance of the constitution and courts”",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets internationally. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to US citizens. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nIMPEACH * REMOVE * CONVICT \n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no tyrants, no dictators, no oligarchs**\n\n\n 👑 ** PLEASE NOTE**\nIn the UK, we DO have a king — and June 14 happens to be his official birthday and parade! So we are NOT using the \"No Kings\" language of other events, and we ask you NOT to bring signs with that phrase. (The picture for this event is automatically set — we can't change it!)\n\n 🤡 ** We're swapping \"No Crowns\" for \"No Clowns!\"** \n we encourage everyone to come dressed as a Tr*mp clown — bad blonde wig, orange face, long red tie, and however creative you want to get! \n\n(If you can do any circus skills and would like to perform at the rally, please email us at indivisiblelondon@protonmail.com!)\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "We are going to be at Erie Pride and we need your help!  Please sign up to volunteer with us at our table.  Talk to your community, have fun and learn more about One Colorado.  \n\nWe’re thrilled to share that One Colorado will be attending 12 Pride events across the state this summer with even more on the calendar for this coming fall. From the Eastern Plains, through the Front Range, and to the Western Slope, we’re traveling far and wide to connect with LGBTQIA+ Coloradans and their families!\n\nAt each stop, we’ll be sharing what we’ve been up to from health equity and safe schools to voter engagement and trans rights. We also want to hear from you! Your stories, your needs, and your voices help shape the work we do every day.\n\nBut let’s also remember that Pride began as a riot, a powerful act of resistance led by trans women of color, fighting back against police brutality and demanding dignity and justice. Pride is a celebration, of course, but it’s also a call to action!\n\nWe hope you’ll walk with us in the continued fight for LGBTQIA+ rights. Whether you’re showing up, speaking out, or volunteering with us, your presence matters. Come say hi, get involved, and let us know how we can best support you and our community.\n\nCome connect with us at your local Pride!",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.** Join the Montclair Dems, BluewaveNJ and a dozen local grassroots groups as gather as a community to say No Kings. We were 8,000+ strong for Hands Off, let's show that we are are here to defend Democracy\n\n\n\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We can only accommodate registered volunteers.)\n\nGleaning involves harvesting food that will not go to market, but is still good food. We then get it distributed right away to a local hunger relief recipient.\n\nThe work will happen in the farm's field in a variety of weather. It *will* involve bending/stooping at this event, some heavy lifting, and generally getting - at least a little - dirty. This will vary each time.\n\nRegistered volunteers will receive specific instructions about where to meet at the farm.",

    "description": "**Join us Wednesday, May 21st, for our May volunteer meeting, where we'll recap Maryland's busy legislative session and share updates on our work to fight the Trump-Musk agenda.**\n\nThis past session, Maryland saw thousands of bills enter the General Assembly, some good and others bad. Come hear more about our fight to hold polluters accountable via the RENEW Act and how we rallied against the Next Generation Energy Act that fast-tracks the permitting process for new toxic gas plants in Maryland.\n\nDuring the meeting, we'll also discuss our federal work, including the reintroduction of the WATER Act and how we're responding to Trump's attacks on climate and the people via extreme budget cuts to vital programs. \n\n**Come organize with us and learn how we'll continue to fight like we live here!**",

    "description": "ALL OUR ACTIONS WILL BE PEACEFUL AND RESPECTFUL!!!\n\nThe last few years in America have seen a record number of bills that attack LGBTQIA+ rights, and now the attack from Trump is targeting transgender military members.\nAccording to USA Today, \"The Supreme Court has ruled against transgender people serving in the military, legitimizing President Donald Trump's discriminatory agenda.\nOn May 6, the nation's highest court decided to allow Trump’s trans military ban to take effect after a lower court had halted its enforcement. Because the decision was part of the “shadow docket” ‒ emergency appeals decided without full briefing or oral argument, and without any written opinion ‒ we don’t know why the justices ruled this way or how the vote was divided, although the three liberal judges on the court say they would have rejected the request that the case be heard.\" https://www.usatoday.com/.../supreme-court.../83499410007/ .\n\nJoin us at the Williamsburg James City County Courthouse, located at 5201 Monticello Avenue, Williamsburg, Virginia, on Friday, June 6th, at NOON to show our support for the LGBTQIA+ Community. It will be hot so please bring a cold beverage, a chair if needed, and take heat precautions, such as a hat or umbrella, etc...\n\nLOVE IS LOVE - SHOW YOUR PRIDE!!!\n\nAs with our previous events, the same rules apply. We will not engage with counter-protesters. If an issue arises, please notify one of the event organizers, who will be wearing Williamsburg JCC Indivisible t-shirts. We will not engage in any acts of violence or violation of any applicable laws or engage in civil disobedience. All actions will be peaceful. Everyone participating in this event will be required to behave lawfully to ensure the safety of event participants and will seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. We will obey the orders of authorized event marshals and law enforcement authorities. Event organizers will not be responsible for any injury or damage if any were to occur during this event. We will park in the Courthouse parking lot without blocking access lanes and will remove any trash that is left. We are committed to maintaining public health measures to practice safe protesting during these times. Please wear a mask and socially distance if that makes you more comfortable - weigh your own risk in attending. Follow all local safety guidelines at minimum, and any safety instructions from hosts that exceed local law.",

We carry a legacy of proven tools, tactics, and collective courage from past movements like ours that can defend democracy and rekindle hope for a bright future.\n\nThis month, we’re partnering with U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal’s Resistance Lab, taking stock of many of these historically effective tools, and getting organized. Join us for MomsRising's May Community Zoom: Resistance Lab on **Thursday, May 22nd, 8:30 pm ET/ 5:30 pm PT,** where we’ll break down how to build the resistance and power the movement we need.\n\nBuilding a brighter future (and expanding our movement) starts with YOU! Moms and caregivers do the work of organizing everyday, whether we know it or not. We hold the worries about the present and the hope for the future, all while keeping on with caring for and loving on our children and communities. \n\nIf ever we needed a movement full of moms and caregivers, it is now.

    "description": "Join MomsRising and Advancement Project for a VIRTUAL Teach-In on Supporting Immigrant Students and Families in Hostile School Environments. \n\nIn today’s polarized political climate, supporting immigrant students in public schools is more critical than ever. As national debates around immigration grow increasingly heated, schools, which should be sanctuaries of learning and belonging, can unintentionally mirror the hostility, fear, and discrimination seen in broader society. Without intentional collective efforts to support immigrant students and families, bias, harmful policies and practices, and a lack of cultural understanding can create environments where immigrant students feel unsafe, unseen, and excluded. Left unchecked, these hostile conditions not only harm students’ academic achievement and mental health but also weaken the fabric of school communities.\n\nIt will take all of us actively fostering inclusive, affirming spaces, in our schools and communities to counteract division, uphold the principles of dignity and opportunity, and ensure that every student, regardless of birthplace or status, has the chance to thrive, lead, and contribute to a stronger, more equitable future for us all because to be honest we are better together.\n\n\nWe can’t wait to share space with you. Don’t forget to RSVP to join and receive event updates including a post event resource guide. \n\nJoin us virtually on Tuesday, June 10th at 6 PM CST / 7 PM EST.",

Please join West Michigan Women Resist, a chapter of Indivisible.org, as we prep for the NO KINGS NATIONAL DAY OF DEFIANCE on June 14th. We will meet Wednesday, May 21st from 6:30-8:30 PM at Oddside Ales in downtown Grand Haven, MI. We'll be poster making, planning, and enjoying each other's camaraderie! Bring friends - All resisters are welcome!!! \n\n\n**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",
