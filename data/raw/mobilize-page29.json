Sometimes, presence alone makes the difference.  \n\nWe invite you to join us in a peaceful and powerful **visibility event** where we will stand together — literally — on safe walk bridges and highway overpasses throughout Akron. With bold, high-visibility signs like **NO KINGS** and **HANDS OFF** and **HIT THE ROAD TRUMP** we’ll remind passing drivers that democracy is worth fighting for.  \n\nThis is an **anti-Trump, anti-Project 2025, pro-democracy event**. We believe in safeguarding the Constitution and resisting efforts to undermine it. **Every voice counts. Every presence matters.** Whether you’re alone or in a group, your participation sends a message: We will not be silent.  \n\n🔹 **Bring a sign** with a short, clear message. Make it bold, make it visible.  \n🔹 **Stand with us** whether for a few minutes or an hour.  \n🔹 **Be seen, be heard, be part of something meaningful.**  \n\nChange begins with visibility. Let’s stand together for democracy.",

    "description": "Take to the streets on May 17 in mass protests to make Trump Must Go NOW! known in cities and towns. These protests combined with dramatic banner drops, vigils, and other creative nonviolent actions across the country in the days going into Saturday, on the day itself, and in the days after can make get this demand seen by millions:\n\nWe all feel it – the atrocities are relentless. Another right snatched away. Someone else disappeared. Due process shredded. Law firms targeted. Universities threatened. Books banned. Immigrants shipped to overseas forever-prisons. Trump promises to disappear “home-growns” (US citizens) next. Trans people banned from the military. It feels impossible to keep up.\n\nWe cannot win by chasing each attack as it comes, overwhelmed and outmatched by the vicious speed of Trump's fascist regime. Nor can we wait until 2026 or 2028.\n\nBut there is a way to win – a way to defeat this fascist juggernaut.\n\nIt is time to come together to take the offense against the whole damn thing — infusing “TRUMP MUST GO NOW!” into all the resistance movements forging a mighty force to stop the regime from carrying out its horrific fascist assault on people here and around the world.\n\nThe Refuse Fascism Call to Conscience/Call to Act breaks down the strategy to oust this regime through mass, sustained, nonviolent protest and resistance. Read it. Sign it at RefuseFascism.org/act Spread it to others.\n\nThen, On May 17, join with others across this country to make a big leap in projecting this demand – Trump Must Go Now! – to the tens of millions who are heartsick and furious about all Trump is doing. Let them see there is a movement for them to join with a real strategy to win. Keep raising this demand all summer long, including at the nationwide protests called for June 14,“No Kings Day”!\n\nIf we act with courage and heart, if we unite all who can be united from diverse political perspectives, we have the numbers and the power to reclaim the future.\n\nIn the Name of Humanity, We Refuse to Accept A Fascist America!",

    "description": "Join us in Woodstock, Vt- where we have been holding an ongoing daily protest from 12-1pm in Tribou Park since Feb 7th.\n\nSat. May 17 will be our 100th day of protesting and we would love for you to stand with us in solidarity!  We know the number of days is not the important thing- but the reasons we all have to stop Trump that are important.  These are the things we care about most, and out of love are committed to standing up for to save.   So many things are at stake.  We need to build our people power and show up for each other during this trying time.\n\nBring a sign or borrow one of ours.  \nWe will have a group art project, postcard writing, sign holding and waving to passerby’s, cookies, and more!  This is a peaceful protest, desiring to make resistance visible- but also desiring to meet new and like minded people, and encourage each other in knowing we are not alone.\n\nOutside- Rain or Shine. \nDress for the weather.\n\nStreet Parking available. Some is metered.  Or free parking in health center lot or east end park.",

It's a promise we intend to keep.\n\nOn June 6th, join thousands of veterans, military families, and their allies on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., for the Unite for Veterans, Unite for America Rally.\n\nWe are coming together to defend the benefits, jobs, and dignity that every generation of veterans has earned through sacrifice.\n\nVeteran jobs, healthcare, and essential VA services are under attack. We will not stand by.\n\nVeterans and military family members are being fired by the thousands from federal jobs. Our healthcare is being gutted. Our benefits are under siege.\n\nThis isn't the first time veterans have had to fight for what was promised. From the Bonus Army of 1932 to the battles for the GI Bill and Agent Orange care, veterans have always led the charge for justice.\n\nNow, it's our turn.\n\nWe rally to:\n\nDefend veteran and military family member employment in the federal workforce\n\nStop the privatization and weakening of the Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nHold political leaders accountable for policies that harm veterans and their families",

But unless this goal is passed by legislation, it could be delayed or eliminated entirely. \n\nBecause the federal administration is moving full speed towards a grid powered by dirty energy, it is up to states to take action on climate change while we still can. And for this bill, we are running out of time. \n\nJoin us at 9am on June 12th at the Trenton State House Annex Building front steps to urge our leaders to pass this crucial legislation. If you want a cleaner and cheaper energy future for New Jersey that is free of dirty fossil fuels, we need your voice! Following this rally and media moment, join us for a day of action lobbying your own legislators - now is the time to make your voice heard. \n\nSign up for more details.",

The Assembly must stop siding with fossil fuel interests and get it done this year!\n\nThe NY HEAT Act is our top climate priority, with its promise of lower energy bills while eliminating massive subsidies to the fracked gas industry.\n\nAs New Yorkers face the threats of climate change and rising costs of living, the NY HEAT Act will make energy more affordable while moving off fossil fuels.\n\n_Rally co-sponsors: All Our Energy, Food & Water Watch, Long Island Progressive Coalition (list in formation)_",
