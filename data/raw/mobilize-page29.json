We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Our Minnetonka Wednesday Weekly Protest event is a peaceful, legal, nonviolent, family-friendly expression of first amendment rights. We will gather on the public sidewalks and grassy banks along the road margins at the intersection of Minnesota State Highway 7 and County Road 101 in Minnetonka where we will display our hand-made signs in view of evening rush hour traffic at a busy intersection. The convener is experienced in protesting at this location in all kinds of weather. The Highway 7 corridor includes communities with some of the highest voter turnout and civic engagement in the entire country. Residents here span the whole political spectrum of the United States of America, but we all agree that there are no kings in America. In between elections, we remind elected officials that no one is above the law and every elected official is accountable to the people under the Constitution. We affirm that American values of democracy, freedom, and rule of law and opposition to Trump's unaffordable policies are broadly supported in our community. \n\nThe Wednesday 21 May 2025 event is the third in a planned long series of Minnetonka Wednesday Weekly Protest events that will continue indefinitely on each Wednesday afternoon through summer, autumn, winter, and into next year as needed until further notice.",

Whether it's generating family walking groups for physical fitness, encouraging youth attend summer day camps, looking forward to reopening the Theatre for Cultural events!  The Queens Night Market is just the start.  May is AAPI and Jewish American Heritage Month.  Business is very important to this community, and I think a great opportunity to come out and vend that Entreprenurial gift you have!  While out, I also encourage you stop by and support my candidacy with your signature that I may get on the ballot.  My Campaign focuses on Aging Gracefully Well regardless of your age and all that supports achieving that goal (ie., small business, education, housing, healthcare and more) and doing so strategically smart in the neighborhoods and City I so love!  My campaign has also added the fight for Anti Semitism and all isms under the umbrella of Public Safety.  That includes Ageism this Older Persons Month.  Looking forward to meeting you to share and learn how you envision District21 and more.  Til then!",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego.

We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

    "description": "NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political positions, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies. They think they rule—but we are bigger than even their worst aspirations.\n\nDonald Trump is planning a military parade in Washington, D.C. on June 14. This display of might is intended to intimidate opponents and solidify his image as a strongman on our dime—we won’t stand by while that happens.\n\nInstead of allowing this military parade to be the center of gravity, we will make action everywhere else the story of America that day: people coming together in communities across the country to reject strongman politics and corruption.\n\nAlongside local organizers, partners, and leaders from across the pro-democracy & pro-worker movement, we will demonstrate organized people power that outpaces any authoritarian aspirations.",

She says these types of actions DO make a difference. Castor says this is a pivot point and we need to stop the Trump administration before it gains more power. \n\nWe will be writing letters and postcards by hand to send to our elected representatives in Washington. Bring your favorite paper or stationery to write letters. Some postcards will be provided. This is the perfect event for those wanting to take action in a fun, relaxed atmosphere with like-minded people. \n\nWe will write about the issues that are hurting Republican lawmakers most, like cuts to SSI, Medicare, Medicaid, and FEMA. Or you can write about any issue that is near and dear to your heart. \n  \nSnacks and beverages will be served, including wine. Feel free to BYOB. We hope to see you on June 6th!",

    "description": "The Hands Off Coalition of Indivisible Twin Cities, MN 50501, Women's March MN, and the AFL-CIO MN are organizing the Twin Cities metro area event on June 14! \n\n12:30PM - Gather together at The Commons in downtown Minneapolis before the march.\n\n1:30PM  - March with us from The Commons down Nicollet Avenue and ending at Loring Park.\n\n2:30PM - Rally in Loring Park, Minneapolis. From inspiring speakers, to bands and activities for all ages, we'll be gathering with neighbors to say NO KINGS.\n\nIn America, we don’t put up with would-be kings. NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.\n\n\nLearn more about this nationwide effort here:\nhttps://www.nokings.org",

We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

    "description": "No Kings! Let Freedom Fly in downtown Brattleboro on Flag Day! \n\nOn Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets again nationwide, standing together in love and unity. Our movement is building - to support justice, a sane society, a stronger world. We stand declaring that the power belongs with the people. That’s US! That’s each and every one of YOU! \n\nCome out and make some noise with us in Brattleboro! We’ll gather at Centre Congregational Church at 3:00 pm, parade with The People's Resistance Marching Band and Becky Graber’s street choir to end up on the Common. \n\nOnce at the Common, protestors will be invited to engage with local groups and organizations at tables for information-sharing and grassroots strength building. You'll also be entertained by circus and street performers PLUS more music! We will celebrate the diversity that makes America shine! All flags welcome.\n\nTogether we call for justice, OUR Constitution to be upheld, and an end to executive overreach. We honor the flag of the United States, a symbol of freedom and national solidarity. We honor the rights of every person within its borders.\n\nWe are no longer interested in simply protesting the damage coming out of Washington, D.C., which affects every individual, we are here to stop it. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, \"A time comes when silence is betrayal.\"  \n\nWe will not be silent, we will gather on the streets on June 14 and every day to follow in our neighborhoods, in collaboration. “The work of bringing people together in mutual recognition and cooperation is never really done”. --Archbishop Anthony Broglio\n\nCo-hosted by Indivisible Brattleboro and Brattleboro Area Action, this partnership is bound by a shared commitment to nonviolence, inclusion, and democratic participation.",

    "description": "🔥We are facing a national crisis. Congress is selling us out by slashing Medicaid, SNAP funding, and more. Why? To give more tax cuts to billionaires.\n\n💸 But the services they’re slashing aren’t theirs—they’re ours. Our communities are paying the price while the Trumps and Musks of the world cash in. It’s not just about money—it’s about power. Trump’s administration is targeting everybody who isn’t part of the 1%—veterans, kids, seniors, farmers, immigrants, transgender people, and political opponents. All to consolidate power and reward their allies.\n\nOn Feb. 25th, Representative Jeff Crank voted to move forward with H. Con. Res. 14 which cuts Medicaid benefits in order to give billionaires a tax cut.  According to Rep. Crank “I think there’s groups out there that are trying to scare people… to try and scare people into believing that there’s going to be all these massive Medicaid cuts. And that hasn’t been the case, that’s not the intention of anybody here, is to cut people off of Medicaid.”   However, H. Con. Res. 14 calls for cuts of $880 billion over the next decade from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees health care spending programs including Medicaid and Medicare. \n\n·         Data shows 19% of Crank’s 5th Congressional District are enrolled in Medicaid\n·         Medicaid covers 6 in 10 nursing home residents\n·         1,174,868 people in Colorado are on Medicaid\n·         Medicaid covers 1 in 3 children in Colorado.\n·         36% of births in CO are covered by Medicaid\n·         65% of adults in CO on Medicaid are working\n·         55% of non-elderly Medicaid enrollees in CO are people of color\n\nIndivisible Colorado Springs and the El Paso County Democrats are holding a Medicaid Budget Cut Panel Discussion so we can clear up misinformation, hear your stories and concerns, and share resources and actionable next steps for our Colorado Springs community to be empowered considering the fear these cuts are creating in our community. We look forward to seeing you there.\n\nWhen: June 10, 2025, 6-8pm (doors open at 5:45pm)\nWhere: IBEW Local 113, 2150 Naegele Rd, Colorado Springs, CO 80904\n\n*Space will be limited to 200 people (max capacity).\n💻You can also join via zoom. More info to come soon.\n\nSign up now and bring a friend!\n\nPre-submit questions for the Medicaid Panel here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEU4rCJ8X2L6KwCJ0GO2xR0VtLv8ukiMG7dEangLGqADl-pw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=108081298308261841541",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego.

We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it. JOIN US!\n\nWe’ve outgrown the corner. It’s time to line the streets! We will line up along SR60 (20th Street) from Panera to Wendy’s and from Chipotle to Outback. \n\nThe NO KINGS protest is organized in partnership with Democrats of Indian River, Democratic Club of Indian River, Indivisible of Indian River County, Liberals in Vero, Newtown Action Alliance, Stop Moms 4 Liberty, Surge 4 Democracy and Young Democrats of Indian River.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",

We ask that signs for this rally focus on veterans and the importance of maintaining the VA. For example, “I love the VA”  “Protect Vets”  “Protect VA employees” “I support the VA” “Vets love the VA”  We appreciate your cooperation.\n\n🚦And a note about parking.

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*\n\nThis event is hosted by BCCR (Bridgewater Communities for Civil Rights).",

    "description": "ONE-MILE \"WE THE PEOPLE\" RALLY: SOUTH SIDE OF MARINE DRIVE ONLY, 18TH TO 35TH STREETS\n\n**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\n\nTrump has gone too far, defying our courts, deporting American citizens, disappearing people off the streets, and slashing our services—all while orchestrating a massive giveaway to his billionaire allies. And now he is using OUR tax dollars to pay for HIS party. That’s why we say: no crowns, no thrones, no kings. \n\nOn June 14, we celebrate People Power. Grab your signs and join us, noon to 1:30 pm, for a “We the People” One-Mile Rally along the south side of Marine Drive in Astoria. Bring a friend (or five or ten) so we can spread out and fill an entire people-powered mile.\n\nThe line-up will run from 18th to 35th Streets. Don’t park in the Maritime Museum or Coast Guard lots. We’re staying on the south side to avoid pedestrian crossings of Marine Drive and make a strong showing.  \n\nThis is a nonviolent protest in celebration of We the People. During the protest, we’ll have opportunities for you to share your community-building stories on video.\n\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\nFollow along with event specific updates through Indivisible Vermilion County's Facebook Event: https://www.facebook.com/share/1Zr2FSsGZ3/.\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.  We will gather at Jon Hunt Memorial Plaza, rally, and march.  We will also be taking food donations for the Portage Pantry.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

Ravi and Katie are fighting to bring progressive, climate justice leadership to North Jersey.\n\n### Logistics:\n- For anyone coming from NYC, Lead Locally can cover transit costs. We'll also provide lunch on both days!\n- Exact canvassing locations TBC, but we will be somewhere around Hoboken or Northern Jersey City. We'll be in touch with everyone that signs up with specifics on location soon.\n- Whether you're knocking doors for the first time or a seasoned canvasser, we’ve got you covered! We’ll begin with some background on the candidates and what is at stake in the race, review the script, and walk through how to use the canvassing app.\n\nThese canvasses are co-sponsored by Food & Water Action.",

Buyers spent an estimated $148 million to win the opportunity to dine with the president.\n\nLet’s be clear: This dinner is corruption embodied. Offering special access to the president in exchange for a scheme that enriches the president borders on bribery. America is not for sale! \n\nThat’s why we’re gathering outside his crypto-corruption dinner to hold him accountable and to urge the Justice Department, the Office of Government Ethics, and Congress to hold him accountable too. \n\nWe deserve a president who is responsive to the needs of the American people, not the greed of his crypto bro donors and billionaires. RSVP to join us this Thursday.",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

This is an opportunity for World Pride attendees, DMV area residents, and the entire LGBTQ+ community to rally around Andry as we demand his return!\n\nAndry is a 31-year-old gay make-up artist and asylum seeker from Venezuela. Despite seeking safety in the United States due to persecution, Andry was unjustly and illegally disappeared to CECOT, an El Salvadorian prison known for its human rights abuses. After months in detention, and missing his asylum hearing, his lawyer lost contact. We demand his immediate return and the chance to present his asylum claim.\n\nThis injustice against Andry is an attack on the entire LGBTQ+ community and the right to seek refuge.\n\nWe'll hear from:\n\n-Jon Lovett, Host of Lovett or Leave It and Co-Host of Pod Save America\n\n-Lindsay Toczylowski, Andry’s Lawyer and President & CEO of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center\n\n-Tim Miller, Host of The Bulwark Podcast\n\n-Sarah Longwell, Publisher of The Bulwark and Host of The Focus Group Podcast\n\nJoin us on Friday the 6th to hear the latest on Andry’s case, and raise your voice in support.",

We’re building a movement that leaves him behind. **NO KINGS** is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n-We are meeting on the **Courthouse Steps** and then marching to the sidewalk in solidarity. \n\n-Safety Volunteers Needed please email- 50501Collier@proton.me to assist. \n\n-A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",

The location and address will be provided closer to the date for privacy reasons.\n\nWe will provide a list of doors to knock, and you will not be speaking about any candidate, so this is a great opportunity for everyone from experienced canvassers to complete rookies. We will largely just be listening to what issues are on voter's minds right now, and seeing where those conversations take us.\n\nYou will need a smartphone with the, \"MiniVAN Touch\" app. If you do not have it, you will need to download it and create an account. If you have knocked doors for Democratic candidates in the last few years, you likely already have it on your phone, but you will still need to log in before the event.

    "description": "Keep the momentum rolling, get your signs ready for week 15!\n\nElon Musk is \"stepping\" down from his role at DOGE but we know he isn't going anywhere. We must continue to protest Musk's role in the administration. Additionally, let's protest the immoral and illegal actions ICE is taking. They're hurting our vulnerable community members with their cruel, shameful tactics and deportations.  (Tesla and ICE are next door to each other) \n\nMeet us at Old Spaghetti Factory around 3:30, where we will leave at 3:45pm sharp to walk over as a group or meet us at Tesla at 4pm. We'll be there during rush hour for prime visibility, ending at around 5:30. Parking is $5/hr at the OSF or on street parking for $2.50/hr. Highly recommend taking public transportation or carpooling- parking will be tight\n\nBring LARGE signs and noise makers. Chairs welcome if you'd like/need to sit. and of course, invite your friends!",

    "description": "At Your Favorite National Monument\n\nBackground\n\nIn April, The Washington Post reported that the Trump administration has a short list of six national monuments they’re considering slashing: Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon (AZ), Ironwood Forest (AZ), Chuckwalla (CA), Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks (NM), Bears Ears (UT) and Grand Staircase-Escalante (UT). President Trump has already signed a proclamation opening up the Pacific Islands Heritage National Monuments to commercial fishing.\n\nPublic land advocates have a narrow window to push back and protect these and other places. In 2017, Trump led the largest rollback of public land protections in history, slashing Utah’s Bears Ears and Grand-Staircase Escalante national monuments by 85 and 47 percent, respectively. In response, nearly 3 million Americans rose up in protest.  Let’s build a loud community of public land defenders across the country. Let the Trump administration know these places are for the people - not billionaires or corporate polluters.   \n\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\nWe hope this day of action will generate media attention at local, state and national levels with visuals of people uniting across some of our country’s most precious landscapes. Even small rallies with honed messaging in critical locations are effective. Additionally, a social media element that reaches voters across the country who support public lands will create a powerful message.\n\nWe invite all public land defenders to participate, whether that’s by posting a photo of their favorite trails to social on June 7 or showing up in person on the land with friends and family. \n\nHow to Join\n\nGather a Group: Bring friends, family, or your organization members to your favorite national monument, national park, or other close-to-home public land.\nView a list of BLM-managed National Monuments and Conservation Lands here.\nView a list of National Park Service-managed national monuments and national parks in New Mexico here.\nBefore you go: If you invite a large group, call the land manager to see if a permit will be required for your expected group size or if there are any other considerations for First Amendment activities. Some monuments have designated First Amendment areas.\n\nMake a homemade sign: Use example slogans or create your own.\n\"Not for Sale / No Se Vende\"\n“Protect Our Parks”\n“Public Lands in Public Hands”\n\"Hands Off National Monuments\"\n\"Protect Sacred Sites\"\n\"Public Lands, Not Private Profit\"\nTake photos\nStand near a national monument sign, notable landmark or gorgeous view.\nShow your signs clearly.\nIf you see signs of destruction and negative impacts from the DOGE firing spree (think: trash at trailheads, “closed” signs, etc), document them and report them to New Mexico Wild here.\nShare online - and pass forward\nTag: #nmwild so we can share your photos!\nTag: #monumentsforall | #handsoff | #notforsale \nTag: Sec. Burgum (@secretaryburgum) and your members of Congress (find your reps here)\nTag: 5 friends, nominating them to go to their favorite monument, park or other public land with a sign.\nSign and share the petition\nCall your members of Congress at (202) 224-3121 and tell them to let the Trump administration know that these places are not for sale.\nWho’s Invited to Join\n\nLocal residents\nTribal Nations & Indigenous advocates\nBusiness owners\nOutdoor recreationists (hikers, climbers, birders, campers)\nHunters & anglers\nConservation groups\nFaith leaders\nArtists & youth\nYOU\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe Trump administration is dismantling our parks to sell them off to billionaires and big corporations. These actions will cut off access to national public lands and destroy wildlife habitats. Removing these monument protections is part of the broader scheme to sell off public lands - and Americans’ shared national heritage.\n\nWe say: Enough is enough. These lands are not for sale.\n\n*** here is the link to the NMWild website where you can click on the link to \"share the petition\" and to RSVP\n\nhttps://www.nmwild.org/event/june-7th-day-of-action-rally-for-your-public-lands/",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

This is an opportunity for World Pride attendees, DMV area residents, and the entire LGBTQ+ community to rally around Andry as we demand his return! \n\nAndry is a 31-year-old gay make-up artist and asylum seeker from Venezuela. Despite seeking safety in the United States due to persecution, Andry was unjustly and illegally disappeared to CECOT, an El Salvadorian prison known for its human rights abuses. After months in detention, and missing his asylum hearing, his lawyer lost contact. We demand his immediate return and the chance to present his asylum claim. \n\nThis injustice against Andry is an attack on the entire LGBTQ+ community and the right to seek refuge.\n\nWe'll hear from:\n\n- Jon Lovett, Host of Lovett or Leave It and Co-Host of Pod Save America\n- Lindsay Toczylowski, Andry’s Lawyer and President & CEO of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center \n- Tim Miller, Host of The Bulwark Podcast \n- Sarah Longwell, Publisher of The Bulwark and Host of The Focus Group Podcast \n\nJoin us on Friday the 6th to hear the latest on Andry’s case, and raise your voice in support.",

They are our neighbors, coworkers, teachers, caregivers, and friends, making up nearly 10% of North Carolina’s population and an essential part of our communities.\n\nBut right now they are facing cruel federal immigration enforcement activities terrorizing communities and bills moving through the NC General Assembly that would make our state play an even bigger role in this inhumane process. \n\nThis is the moment where we must stand together in opposition to these harmful policies and for the kind of state and people we want to be. Your voice is needed right now to stand alongside our immigrant neighbors and speak out for those who may feel unsafe speaking up themselves. \n\nIf your situation is such that you feel safe doing so, we urge you to join us Wednesday, May 21, for the NC Immigrant Rights Day of Action. RSVP now to let us know to expect you!\n\nHere are all the details:\n\nWhat: NC Immigrant Rights Day of Action\n\nWhen: Wednesday, May 21, 10 am to 1 pm\n\nWhere: Gather at the Bicentennial Plaza, directly across the street from the North Carolina General Assembly, 16 West Jones St., Raleigh, NC \n\nJoin MomsRising/ MamásConPoder and our partners as we stand together in solidarity for the NC we all deserve.

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.** Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

    "description": "People from all over the world come to southern Arizona to experience the great outdoors, recreate, and just be among the area’s scenic landscapes and wildlife. But how much is that worth, and what are the costs if it’s lost? \n\nJoin Sky Island Alliance for our next virtual Coffee Break on June 12 at 9:30 a.m. We’ll be joined by Borderlands Restoration Network board member Chuck Klingenstein, who will share results from the first [Nature-Based Restorative Economy study](https://santacruzcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Santa-Cruz-County-NBRE-Full-Report.pdf) in Santa Cruz County, commissioned by the community and conducted by the University of Arizona. \n\nThis in-depth study looked at the many benefits nature provides to our economy in southern Arizona through ecotourism, conservation, and other activities. SIA Executive Director Louise Misztal will also provide updates on South32’s Hermosa Mine in the Patagonia Mountains and how you can speak up for this natural gem that supports our well-being and economy by taking action during the current comment period on the mine’s impacts.\n\n**More Background**\n\nThe Nature-Based Restorative Economy study was conducted by the University of Arizona, and it was commissioned by the Town of Patagonia, Sky Island Tourism Association, Borderlands Restoration Network, Tucson Bird Alliance, The Nature Conservancy, Patagonia Area Resource Alliance, and Sky Island Alliance, as well as other organizations, businesses, and individuals active in Santa Cruz County, Arizona. The purpose of the study was to understand the components of the nature-based restorative economy in Santa Cruz County by using traditional economic modeling. The study also separated out these components, since the nature-based restorative economy isn’t currently a defined sector in government data sets.\n\nSpecific Study Goals\n\n- To define the components of the nature-based restorative economy in Santa Cruz County and collect data on its contribution to the overall economy. This was the first time this has been done.\n\n- To measure the growth of the nature-based restorative economy sector by collecting baseline data for future comparison.\n\n- To inform elected officials and other policymakers, businesses, nonprofits, and the public about the current economic impacts and potential opportunities for growth afforded by the nature-based restorative economy in Santa Cruz County.",
