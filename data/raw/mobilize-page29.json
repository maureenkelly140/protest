    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

It's a promise we intend to keep.\n\nOn June 6th, join thousands of veterans, military families, and their allies on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., for the Unite for Veterans, Unite for America Rally.\n\nWe are coming together to defend the benefits, jobs, and dignity that every generation of veterans has earned through sacrifice.\n\nVeteran jobs, healthcare, and essential VA services are under attack. We will not stand by.\n\nVeterans and military family members are being fired by the thousands from federal jobs. Our healthcare is being gutted. Our benefits are under siege.\n\nThis isn't the first time veterans have had to fight for what was promised. From the Bonus Army of 1932 to the battles for the GI Bill and Agent Orange care, veterans have always led the charge for justice.\n\nNow, it's our turn.\n\nWe rally to:\n\nDefend veteran and military family member employment in the federal workforce\n\nStop the privatization and weakening of the Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nHold political leaders accountable for policies that harm veterans and their families",

    "description": "No Kings Day of Action:\nProtest & Picnic\nFighting Tyranny Through Community, Joy, and Action\n\nJune 14, 11-2pm\nPierce Park, Chelsea, MI\n\nOn June 14 - Flag Day - Donald Trump wants tanks in the street and a made-for-TV display of dominance for his birthday. A spectacle meant to look like strength. But real power isn’t staged in Washington, it rises up everywhere in we the people.  No Kings is a nationwide day of defiance. From city blocks to small towns, from courthouse steps to community parks, we are taking action to reject authoritarianism - and show the world what democracy looks like.\n\nJoin us for a joyful community gathering where we rise together to fight tyranny with collective strength, celebration, and courage.\n\nHear from local nonprofits and progressive organizations about how to take action right here, right now.  Explore info tables to get involved with ongoing efforts and build real change in our community.\n\nThen stay for an afternoon of resistance and renewal: a peaceful protest, live music, snacks, and creative activities.  Bring a picnic blanket, your family, your friends, your voice, and your joy.\n\nBecause community is our shield. resistance is our weapon. The flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. Let’s take up space, take care of each other, and take action - together.\n\nHosted by Chelsea Grassroots * One World One Family * Dexter strong, Dexter cares.\n\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Join us for a rally outside Assemblymember Chuck Lavine's office to urge him to fight for clean and affordable energy by co-sponsoring and helping pass the NY HEAT Act.\n\n**With the state budget finally done, Albany lawmakers must prioritize passing the NY HEAT Act in the waning weeks of the legislative session.**\n\nNew Yorkers are being crushed by unaffordable utility bills, and the NY HEAT Act is the solution we need — but Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and legislative leadership are dragging their feet to put it to a vote.\n\nThe Senate has passed NY HEAT two years in a row. The Assembly must stop siding with fossil fuel interests and get it done this year!\n\nThe NY HEAT Act is our top climate priority, with its promise of lower energy bills while eliminating massive subsidies to the fracked gas industry.\n\nAs New Yorkers face the threats of climate change and rising costs of living, the NY HEAT Act will make energy more affordable while moving off fossil fuels.\n\n_Rally co-sponsors: All Our Energy, Food & Water Watch, Long Island Progressive Coalition, Renewable Heat Now, Green Party of Nassau County (list in formation)_",

Any Monday, every Monday. If you would care to: bring a sign, bring a voice, bring perhaps a bit of outrage, and bring a HAT.\n\nThis event is inspired by Vicki (daily at the corner of 5th and Shady, 5PM to 6PM) who has proven that one person's efforts have vast reach. Her largest audience to date was 2,000 people. This is also in keeping with the growing movement by Indivisible members who are selecting an accessible corner for non-violent protest and standing up to tyranny!\n\nPlease, feel free to join me! The more the merrier!",

    "description": "Join us for a Day of Action at the Texas Capitol: Double Down for Democracy — Modernize Voter Registration, Don’t Restrict It!\n\nFor the first time in over a decade, the House Elections Committee is holding a public hearing on online voter registration on Thursday, 5/15 at 8AM. This is a rare and important opportunity to show that Texans overwhelmingly support this commonsense, popular policy by registering your support for the bill (dropping a card).\n\nWhile we’re excited to highlight OVR, we want to be clear: HB 311 has no path forward this session, as the hearing is happening after a key legislative deadline.\n\nAt the same time, a real threat looms — new proof of citizenship requirements that could severely restrict voter registration access are making their way through the Legislature.\n\nThat’s why we're not backing down, we’re doubling down for democracy. On Thursday, we’ll show support for HB 311 at the hearing by dropping cards and then visit legislative offices to urge lawmakers to oppose anti-voter bills like SB 16.\n\nMore details will be shared upon RSVPing! \n\nIf you can't make it in person, you can submit online public comments here: https://www.mobilize.us/movetexas/event/788642/",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Join the Lancaster Democrats for a book talk on \"Robert F. Kennedy: The Road Not Taken\" with authors Dennis Crawford & Dr. Laura Crawford. Coffee and cookies will be provided and copies of the book will be available for purchase. Join us to learn about Robert F. Kennedy's campaign for President right here in Nebraska! \n\nAbout the book:\n\nThe Nebraska Democratic primary mattered in 1968. Because only fifteen states held primaries, Robert F. Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy made the state a high priority.\n\nBefore the reforms of the 1970s, most delegates to the national convention were selected in conventions and caucuses in which party leaders controlled the outcome. The candidates campaigned extensively in Nebraska to prove to the party bosses that they could carry farm states in the general election.\n\nThe Kennedy and McCarthy campaigns began to organize in Nebraska in early 1968. Both candidates campaigned hard in Nebraska. McCarthy literally worked himself into a state of exhaustion.\n\nNebraska brought out the best in Kennedy, and he brought out the best in Nebraska voters. He gave a hydrocephalic baby love at the Beatrice State Home and scolded draft-dodging students at Creighton University. Kennedy was genuinely concerned about the future of a school-age Black girl he met in north Omaha.\n\nKennedy defeated McCarthy by a decisive 52 percent to 31 percent margin. This big win put Kennedy on the path to the Democratic nomination and the White House.\n\nAbout the Authors:\n\nDennis P. Crawford was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. House of Representative in 2014. A lifelong resident of Lincoln, Nebraska, Dennis earned his undergraduate degree in political science at Creighton University in 1982 and his law degree at the Catholic University of America in 1985. He returned to his hometown after he graduated from law school and practiced law in the Nebraska courts between 1986–2023. Dennis was a trial lawyer who represented people who were injured in accidents. \n\nCrawford’s run for Congress was emblematic of his lifetime of interest in government and politics. Ever since returning from law college in Washington, D.C., Dennis has been politically active in Nebraska politics. He served as Second Associate Chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party between 2012 and 2016.  \n\nDennis is married to Diane, and they have three adult children and one grandson.  He enjoys spending his free time following the Nebraska Cornhusker football team. \n\nDr. Laura J. Crawford is the Assistant State Archaeologist at the Nebraska Historical Society in Lincoln.

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego.

We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego.

We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",

    "description": "HAVE FUN AND BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN YOUR PROTESTS\n--De-escalate tension and create more Instagrammable moments when you learn to utilize clowning as a playful means to address the injustices of authoritarianism. Clowns have always been society’s tricksters - exposing truths, mocking power, and bringing disruption & play to the frontlines of protests.\n\nTHE UNIQUE SPACE A CLOWN OCCUPIES derives its power from being on the fringes, from being not-quite-like-the-others, being a commentator, a rebel, a soothsayer. \n\n--STREET THEATRE is the key ingredient in STRATEGIC NONVIOLENT ACTION.  Explore clown as trickster, shaman, spectacle: who heals and critiques by disrupting the status quo.\n\nDISCOVER YOUR ACTIVIST CLOWN\nTap into your inner activist clown with Indivisible activist Sheridan Hill and her UK colleague Robyn Hambrook www.robynhambrook.com A UK-based director, teacher and performer, Robyn is a passionate practitioner of clowning, physical theatre, circus and street arts, and founder of the Bristol Clown School.\n\n-AN ANTIDOTE TO THESE OVERWHELMING TIMES, this four-part series will prepare you to speak truth to power at your next event, make a more significant impact than ever before, and have so much fun at the same time. \n\n-A TRICKSTER’S GUIDE TO PLAYFUL REBELLION will explore the rebellious history and tactics of activist clowning, from ancient fools to modern disruptors. Through history, case studies, and hands-on exercises, we’ll play with the tools of satire, spectacle, and collective mischief to challenge the status quo—one red nose at a time.\n\n--FIRST FOUR TUESDAYS IN JULY AT NOON EDT, this 4-part workshop series explores the dynamics of clowning; from the deeply regenerative practice of play, presence and pleasure to the liberation in being ridiculous, transgressive and rebellious.\n\nZOOM REMINDERS: Please leave your audio OFF and use the chat to talk to each other; Robyn needs our hour to teach. These classes will be part lecture and part practicum, with your video on so we can see each other.\n\nMORE ABOUT ROBYN HAMBROOK\n\nOver the past six years, Robyn Hambrook has been researching the intersection of clowning and protest driven by a deep desire to address the injustices in the world. This research has taken place in the streets, in protests, in research labs, online, with international collaborators and her Masters Research; ‘Small Circus Acts of Resistance’.\n\nRobyn’s recent collaborations and teaching projects include the Nomadic Rebel Clown Academy (5-day Activist Clown Training), The Laboratory of the Un-beautiful (Feminist Grotesque Bouffon Training for Womxn Theatre Makers) and the Clown Congress (annual gathering of clowns, activists and academics collectively exploring what it means to be a clown in this current era). Robyn has most recently founded the Bristol Clown School, creating a home for clowning in the South West of England.\nwww.robynhambrook.com / www.bristolclownschool.co.uk",

NO KINGS! \n\n10am-12pm\n\n**Please note it may be HOT! Be prepared with water, hat etc to stay safe & healthy.\n\n\n**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We will gather in Mansfield at the corner of 195 and 275 at 3:00 P.M. to protest. Wear Red (if you can) to signify red lines (the Red line of Genocide) that we won't cross.

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "The Trump administration, its allies in Congress, and Elon Musk will do anything to shut down Planned Parenthood health centers, no matter how many patients lose health care. These politicians don't care about patients; they only want to give tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations.\n\nThe majority of Planned Parenthood health center patients — especially women, people of color, LGBTQ+ people, immigrants, and people with low incomes — rely on publicly funded programs, like Medicaid and Title X, to get quality reproductive health care. Attacks on Medicaid and Title X threaten millions of people's access to birth control, cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, and more. \n \nStarting Tuesday, 5/13, members of Congress will attend hearings about proposed legislation that could  “defund” Planned Parenthood and gut Medicaid by billions of dollars. Join Planned Parenthood Action Fund on May 13 and 14 to attend these hearings– we need your help to pack the rooms and show our support for essential health care! Sign up for a shift and/or drop in for however long! Additional information will be shared upon registration. Email us at volunteer@ppfa.org for questions. \n\n\nPlease select all shifts that you are available to attend.",

The more people who sign up to attend, the more we amplify our collective voice and let folks around the state know: we’re here, and we’re here for them.\n\nWill you attend at least one rural Pride event in 2025?\nYou might not realize how much your presence matters. But it does.\nIt sends a message—to our communities, to potential allies, and to anyone who might try to silence or intimidate us.\n\nWe show up for each other.\nWe are Kentucky.",

    "description": "Trump’s administration is in full-on power grab mode, shredding laws, defying courts, and handing control of the country’s financial system to a billionaire crony. We need all-out, relentless pressure to stop this coup in its tracks.\n\n📍 Where: [ 5180 Mayfield Rd, Lyndhurst, OH 44124]\n📅 When: [May 17th 12-2 pm]\n\nSign up now and bring a friend!\n\nWe are continuing to make it clear to Musk/Vance/Trump that we will not stand for their lawless agenda. They are ignoring our democratic freedoms, dismantling government agencies, stealing our data, disenfranchising voters, limiting First Amendment rights and violating the Constitution by denying Due Process to many folks\n. \nRules & Reminders: Gather in front of Tesla Motors, 5150 Mayfield Rd, Lyndhurst, OH. Do not park in their lot or engage with their employees and customers. Bring a sign, flag and good spirits, Stay on the sidewalk & allow pedestrians to pass, Do not jaywalk across Mayfield Road (police will be watching), Use the crosswalk just west of Tesla, Don't block driveway entrances or exits, Don't harass Tesla customers or employees, Do not argue with counter protesters, PROTEST PEACEFULLY. Watch for peacekeepers in yellow vests and immediately report any disturbances to them. Follow any instructions from Lyndhurst Police.\nParking is available at Messiah Lutheran Church, 5200 Mayfield Road. Please be respectful and park on the EAST SIDE of the lot first (away from the Tesla Store). Additional parking is available at the Lyndhurst Community of Faith Church, 5312 Mayfield Road. Please enter the EAST DRIVEWAY as the west driveway is exit only. Local street parking is also just a short stroll away. \n\nThe stakes couldn’t be higher. No one is coming to save us. Not politicians, not the media, not the courts.\n\nThis is a peaceful protest movement. We oppose violence, vandalism and destruction of property. This protest is a lawful exercise of our First Amendment right to peaceful assembly.\n\n\n📢 How to Prepare for Your Event:\n✅ Bring signs or props → Make your message visible! (Ideas: “MUSK OR US,” “NO KINGS”, “PROTECT OUR MEDICAID”, “NO TAX BREAKS FOR BILLIONAIRES”)\n✅ Recruit friends → The more people, the more power.\n✅ Record everything → Post photos/videos with #MuskOrUs and tag @IndivisibleTeam.",

    "description": "Please join us for a virtual phone bank ahead of our Southern Idaho town halls! On May 22nd, we’ll be meeting at 5:30pm MT via Zoom to make phone calls to community members to invite them to upcoming town halls.\n\nDuring the 2025 legislative session, Idaho lawmakers passed House Bill 93 and enacted a $50 million school-voucher program. For the first time in state history, Idaho tax dollars will be used to subsidize the cost of tuition for private-school families.\n\nThe special-interest groups promoting vouchers have made clear that the $50 million program is only the beginning. During next year’s legislative session, they intend to remove the $50-million cap and expand the program to all private-school families, including the wealthy, at an estimated cost of $339 million per year.\n\nSuch a massive expansion of vouchers would bankrupt Idaho and drain millions from public schools. For the benefit of a small number of private-school families, it would defund the public education system that serves 94% of Idaho’s kids.\n\nIt may be inevitable that the legislature tries to expand House Bill 93, but it is not inevitable that they will succeed. To stop this attack on public schools, we need to get organized. Please sign up if you can make it and we hope to see you soon!",

    "description": "June 14th is Flag Day and Donald Trump's birthday. To celebrate \"him\" he wants to have a massive military parade on that day in Washington D.C. Everything he has done is with the motivation of being the equivalent of a KING.  Attacks on the Judicial Branch, requiring total allegiance from the Legislative Branch, filling the Executive Branch with sycophants who blindly do his bidding...all show he wants to be a dictator/king.  We fought the Revolutionary Way almost 250 years ago to get out from under a king's yolk.  If we fought for no king then, we must continue to fight for no king NOW.\n\nIndivisible and other partners are sponsoring a nationwide protest against giving up to a king.  Join Indivisible Auburn to show that we do not accept a dictator.  We will meet on the sidewalks by the Auburn/Placer Courthouse on Maple Street from 3-4:30 p.m.\n\nLet's make this a lively and creative event.  Do you have a revolutionary war costume? Or something else appropriate?  Music? Signs for NO KINGS?  We will have a sign making date where we will make Big Crowns with Big \"X\"s....Maybe tea bag leis?  Any ideas?  Let's take back the flag on flag day. MAGAs try to claim the flag just for their warped version of patriotism. Bring flags, small, large, whatever.  Maybe flags from countries we support (Ukraine, Canada, Greenland, EU, or whatever)\n\nBring water and maybe sunscreen.  If you have issues standing, bring a chair.\n\nLet's show Auburn and the country that it is the people who should have the power, not a self-appointed king.",

    "description": "We’re less than three months away from the August primary. I’ve run a lot of campaigns over the years, and I know how important it is to set ambitious but achievable goals. So I’m calling it now. Here’s what we’re going to do, together:\n\nWe’re going to be in first place on August 5th.\n\nThat’s right, you heard it. We’re not just going to make it through the primary. We’re going to win more votes than Bruce Harrell.\n\nWe can absolutely do this. But it’s not going to happen automatically, and it’s not going to be easy. That said, there is one easy thing you can do right now to help us achieve this goal:\n\nRSVP for the This Is Your City Rally coming up on Saturday, May 31st. [link]\n\nThis rally will kick off an intense, all-hands-on-deck, ten-week stretch of bringing our message to voters — especially infrequent and new voters — across Seattle. Because THAT is how we’re going to win first place in the primary: by talking face-to-face with tens of thousands of people who aren’t going to vote this year unless we reach them.\n\nNeedless to say, I’m going to need your help, whether that’s knocking on doors, phonebanking, talking to people at festivals and light rail stations, writing letters to fellow tenants in your apartment building, or texting your friends and family. You can do a lot of that right now, of course — but we’re all going to have to turn it up a notch in the final stretch.\n\nBut beyond all that, here are three reasons why I’m really hoping to see you on May 31st:\n\nTo show our strength. Our rally will send a clear message to all the people who still think Harrell has this race locked down. At our March kickoff, 150 people came together to launch this campaign. Let’s demonstrate how much our numbers have grown!\n\nTo build for the long haul. I know we can win this race, but it’s about much more than getting one person elected. When I’m in City Hall, it’s not like the entrenched interests that are fighting us on the campaign trail are going to give up and say “How can we help?” They’re going to keep fighting us. They’re going to try to make sure I’m not able to do any of the good things we want to see happen for Seattle, and they’re going to try to turn the public against us. We’re going to need a powerful movement of people on the outside, organizing and building power, so we can make progress. Building that movement starts now.\n\nOh yeah, and it’s going to be fun! Great company, good food, rousing speeches (but not too many), and meaningful action. I’m not saying there will be cornhole, but I’m also not saying there won’t be. What better way to spend a couple hours on your Saturday? \n\nLocation and time are TBD, but it will be transit accessible. It will help us plan if you RSVP now!",

Sunday, June 22, 2025.\n\nGet your Kentucky Pride Passport from your local gay bar or at the pride festival from your local Democratic booth.\n\nWe’re working to drive attendance to Pride 2025 events—especially rural Pride celebrations—as a form of joyful resistance and powerful protest.\n\nOrganized by the LGBTQIA Council for Kentucky Democrats, this campaign is about more than parades and parties. The more people who sign up to attend, the more we amplify our collective voice and let folks around the state know: we’re here, and we’re here for them.\n\nWill you attend at least one rural Pride event in 2025? You might not realize how much your presence matters. But it does. It sends a message—to our communities, to potential allies, and to anyone who might try to silence or intimidate us.\n\nWe show up for each other. We are Kentucky.\n\nTickets for this event are $50 and you can purchase through the Owensboro Pride Eventbrite. https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owensboro-blue-bridge-pride-picnic-2025-tickets-1265566115319?aff=efbevent&fbclid=IwY2xjawKPKA9leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFOdlMwbTNYd3M5enBjejROAR4Z05LU8zTlNzP7rL8HRgXv0r5ZxPOJSjF2igorh4ZXlFOCajy0uyHTKIBT9g_aem_NrLB51a_1a4LAFRxuv50ZQ",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

But in 2025-26, we need to do something more and different to win.  House parties can:\n\n- Reach voters outside of our political bubbles\n\n- Have friend and neighbor conversations with those who support our democratic values\n\n- Inoculate voters against the onslaught of right-wing media\n\n- Expand our volunteer base\n\n**Are you thinking about hosting a house party, but don't know how to get started?**  If you've never hosted one before (and even if you're a fellow introvert), or just want a refresher, join the Bay Area Coalition every Monday, 5 pm (PT) / 7 pm (CT) / 8 pm (ET) for our ** *nationwide* ** house party workshop ...\n\n - How to plan your house party\n\n - Tips and tools for hosting conversations with your friends, neighbors, colleagues\n\n*You'll leave the workshop fired up and ready to host your house party!*\n\nFor more Bay Area Coalition actions: https://bayareacoalition.org/",

    "description": "This week, Congress will hear the long-awaited federal voucher program in the US House Ways & Means Committee. The program, formerly known as “ECCA” and now called “Qualified Elementary and Secondary Education Scholarships,” would create a 100% tax break for the wealthy, allowing them to divert their taxes to support private education. Just like Arizona’s voucher program, this federal voucher would predominantly benefit students already attending (and already affording) private schools.\n\nJoin Save Our Schools Arizona for a No Federal Vouchers Power (Half) Hour. We'll get a brief overview on a national private school voucher program being pushed through the U.S. House this week and then we’ll call our US Senators & Representative and tell them to reject Federal vouchers!",

    "description": "Leaflet and talk with constituents of [R] Rep. Lawler in Tarrytown, in the purple district of NY17 about the very unpopular budget/reconciliation bill that would cut trillions from Medicaid, and much more so that billionaires could get trillions in tax cuts. If Rep. Lawler gets lots of calls telling him to vote against this budget bill, it is possible to defeat it. The Republicans majority in the House is so small that the loss of Lawler's vote could kill it. We'll be meeting at Grand Central Station [information kiosk] at 9:30am to take a Metro North train to Tarrytown [arriving at 10:39am]. We'll have leaflets and wear signs \"No Cuts to Medicaid\" and \"Billionaires Do Not Need Tax Cuts\". We'll be approaching people in high traffic areas with leaflets and talk to them about this Tax Scam budget, urge them to phone Rep. Lawler and tell them about local actions planned by local groups that we work with. \n\n\nSwing Left is a grassroots organization that helps people make an impact in the elections that determine the national balance of power in the country. Our goal is simple: elect Democrats to help strengthen our democracy.",
