The more people who sign up to attend, the more we amplify our collective voice and let folks around the state know: we’re here, and we’re here for them.\n\nWill you attend at least one rural Pride event in 2025?\nYou might not realize how much your presence matters. But it does.\nIt sends a message—to our communities, to potential allies, and to anyone who might try to silence or intimidate us.\n\nWe show up for each other.\nWe are Kentucky.",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "The Trump administration, its allies in Congress, and Elon Musk will do anything to shut down Planned Parenthood health centers, no matter how many patients lose health care. These politicians don't care about patients; they only want to give tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations.\n\nThe majority of Planned Parenthood health center patients — especially women, people of color, LGBTQ+ people, immigrants, and people with low incomes — rely on publicly funded programs, like Medicaid and Title X, to get quality reproductive health care. Attacks on Medicaid and Title X threaten millions of people's access to birth control, cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, and more. \n \nStarting Tuesday, 5/13, members of Congress will attend hearings about proposed legislation that could  “defund” Planned Parenthood and gut Medicaid by billions of dollars. Join Planned Parenthood Action Fund on May 13 and 14 to attend these hearings– we need your help to pack the rooms and show our support for essential health care! Sign up for a shift and/or drop in for however long! Additional information will be shared upon registration. Email us at volunteer@ppfa.org for questions. \n\n\nPlease select all shifts that you are available to attend.",

    "description": "Trump’s administration is in full-on power grab mode, shredding laws, defying courts, and handing control of the country’s financial system to a billionaire crony. We need all-out, relentless pressure to stop this coup in its tracks.\n\n📍 Where: [ 5180 Mayfield Rd, Lyndhurst, OH 44124]\n📅 When: [May 17th 12-2 pm]\n\nSign up now and bring a friend!\n\nWe are continuing to make it clear to Musk/Vance/Trump that we will not stand for their lawless agenda. They are ignoring our democratic freedoms, dismantling government agencies, stealing our data, disenfranchising voters, limiting First Amendment rights and violating the Constitution by denying Due Process to many folks\n. \nRules & Reminders: Gather in front of Tesla Motors, 5150 Mayfield Rd, Lyndhurst, OH. Do not park in their lot or engage with their employees and customers. Bring a sign, flag and good spirits, Stay on the sidewalk & allow pedestrians to pass, Do not jaywalk across Mayfield Road (police will be watching), Use the crosswalk just west of Tesla, Don't block driveway entrances or exits, Don't harass Tesla customers or employees, Do not argue with counter protesters, PROTEST PEACEFULLY. Watch for peacekeepers in yellow vests and immediately report any disturbances to them. Follow any instructions from Lyndhurst Police.\nParking is available at Messiah Lutheran Church, 5200 Mayfield Road. Please be respectful and park on the EAST SIDE of the lot first (away from the Tesla Store). Additional parking is available at the Lyndhurst Community of Faith Church, 5312 Mayfield Road. Please enter the EAST DRIVEWAY as the west driveway is exit only. Local street parking is also just a short stroll away. \n\nThe stakes couldn’t be higher. No one is coming to save us. Not politicians, not the media, not the courts.\n\nThis is a peaceful protest movement. We oppose violence, vandalism and destruction of property. This protest is a lawful exercise of our First Amendment right to peaceful assembly.\n\n\n📢 How to Prepare for Your Event:\n✅ Bring signs or props → Make your message visible! (Ideas: “MUSK OR US,” “NO KINGS”, “PROTECT OUR MEDICAID”, “NO TAX BREAKS FOR BILLIONAIRES”)\n✅ Recruit friends → The more people, the more power.\n✅ Record everything → Post photos/videos with #MuskOrUs and tag @IndivisibleTeam.",

House parties can:\n\n- Reach voters outside of our political bubbles\n\n- Have friend and neighbor conversations with those who support our democratic values\n\n- Inoculate voters against the onslaught of right-wing media\n\n- Expand our volunteer base\n\n**Are you thinking about hosting a house party, but don't know how to get started?**  If you've never hosted one before (and even if you're a fellow introvert), or just want a refresher, join the Bay Area Coalition every Monday, 7 pm (PT) for our ** *California-wide* ** house party workshop ...\n\n - How to plan your house party\n\n - Tips and tools for hosting conversations with your friends, neighbors, colleagues\n\n - Learn PDI-on-the-GO to find your local Democrats, or others who share our values\n\n*You'll leave the workshop fired up and ready to host your house party!*\n\nFor more Bay Area Coalition actions: https://bayareacoalition.org/",

    "description": "Please join us for a virtual phone bank ahead of our Southern Idaho town halls! On May 22nd, we’ll be meeting at 5:30pm MT via Zoom to make phone calls to community members to invite them to upcoming town halls.\n\nDuring the 2025 legislative session, Idaho lawmakers passed House Bill 93 and enacted a $50 million school-voucher program. For the first time in state history, Idaho tax dollars will be used to subsidize the cost of tuition for private-school families.\n\nThe special-interest groups promoting vouchers have made clear that the $50 million program is only the beginning. During next year’s legislative session, they intend to remove the $50-million cap and expand the program to all private-school families, including the wealthy, at an estimated cost of $339 million per year.\n\nSuch a massive expansion of vouchers would bankrupt Idaho and drain millions from public schools. For the benefit of a small number of private-school families, it would defund the public education system that serves 94% of Idaho’s kids.\n\nIt may be inevitable that the legislature tries to expand House Bill 93, but it is not inevitable that they will succeed. To stop this attack on public schools, we need to get organized. Please sign up if you can make it and we hope to see you soon!",

We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings!

    "description": "June 14th is Flag Day and Donald Trump's birthday. To celebrate \"him\" he wants to have a massive military parade on that day in Washington D.C. Everything he has done is with the motivation of being the equivalent of a KING.  Attacks on the Judicial Branch, requiring total allegiance from the Legislative Branch, filling the Executive Branch with sycophants who blindly do his bidding...all show he wants to be a dictator/king.  We fought the Revolutionary Way almost 250 years ago to get out from under a king's yolk.  If we fought for no king then, we must continue to fight for no king NOW.\n\nIndivisible and other partners are sponsoring a nationwide protest against giving up to a king.  Join Indivisible Auburn to show that we do not accept a dictator.  We will meet on the sidewalks by the Auburn/Placer Courthouse on Maple Street from 3-4:30 p.m.\n\nLet's make this a lively and creative event.  Do you have a revolutionary war costume? Or something else appropriate?  Music? Signs for NO KINGS?  We will have a sign making date where we will make Big Crowns with Big \"X\"s....Maybe tea bag leis?  Any ideas?  Let's take back the flag on flag day. MAGAs try to claim the flag just for their warped version of patriotism. Bring flags, small, large, whatever.  Maybe flags from countries we support (Ukraine, Canada, Greenland, EU, or whatever)\n\nBring water and maybe sunscreen.  If you have issues standing, bring a chair.\n\nLet's show Auburn and the country that it is the people who should have the power, not a self-appointed king.",

    "description": "We’re less than three months away from the August primary. I’ve run a lot of campaigns over the years, and I know how important it is to set ambitious but achievable goals. So I’m calling it now. Here’s what we’re going to do, together:\n\nWe’re going to be in first place on August 5th.\n\nThat’s right, you heard it. We’re not just going to make it through the primary. We’re going to win more votes than Bruce Harrell.\n\nWe can absolutely do this. But it’s not going to happen automatically, and it’s not going to be easy. That said, there is one easy thing you can do right now to help us achieve this goal:\n\nRSVP for the This Is Your City Rally coming up on Saturday, May 31st. [link]\n\nThis rally will kick off an intense, all-hands-on-deck, ten-week stretch of bringing our message to voters — especially infrequent and new voters — across Seattle. Because THAT is how we’re going to win first place in the primary: by talking face-to-face with tens of thousands of people who aren’t going to vote this year unless we reach them.\n\nNeedless to say, I’m going to need your help, whether that’s knocking on doors, phonebanking, talking to people at festivals and light rail stations, writing letters to fellow tenants in your apartment building, or texting your friends and family. You can do a lot of that right now, of course — but we’re all going to have to turn it up a notch in the final stretch.\n\nBut beyond all that, here are three reasons why I’m really hoping to see you on May 31st:\n\nTo show our strength. Our rally will send a clear message to all the people who still think Harrell has this race locked down. At our March kickoff, 150 people came together to launch this campaign. Let’s demonstrate how much our numbers have grown!\n\nTo build for the long haul. I know we can win this race, but it’s about much more than getting one person elected. When I’m in City Hall, it’s not like the entrenched interests that are fighting us on the campaign trail are going to give up and say “How can we help?” They’re going to keep fighting us. They’re going to try to make sure I’m not able to do any of the good things we want to see happen for Seattle, and they’re going to try to turn the public against us. We’re going to need a powerful movement of people on the outside, organizing and building power, so we can make progress. Building that movement starts now.\n\nOh yeah, and it’s going to be fun! Great company, good food, rousing speeches (but not too many), and meaningful action. I’m not saying there will be cornhole, but I’m also not saying there won’t be. What better way to spend a couple hours on your Saturday? \n\nLocation and time are TBD, but it will be transit accessible. It will help us plan if you RSVP now!",

Sunday, June 22, 2025.\n\nGet your Kentucky Pride Passport from your local gay bar or at the pride festival from your local Democratic booth.\n\nWe’re working to drive attendance to Pride 2025 events—especially rural Pride celebrations—as a form of joyful resistance and powerful protest.\n\nOrganized by the LGBTQIA Council for Kentucky Democrats, this campaign is about more than parades and parties. The more people who sign up to attend, the more we amplify our collective voice and let folks around the state know: we’re here, and we’re here for them.\n\nWill you attend at least one rural Pride event in 2025? You might not realize how much your presence matters. But it does. It sends a message—to our communities, to potential allies, and to anyone who might try to silence or intimidate us.\n\nWe show up for each other. We are Kentucky.\n\nTickets for this event are $50 and you can purchase through the Owensboro Pride Eventbrite. https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owensboro-blue-bridge-pride-picnic-2025-tickets-1265566115319?aff=efbevent&fbclid=IwY2xjawKPKA9leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFOdlMwbTNYd3M5enBjejROAR4Z05LU8zTlNzP7rL8HRgXv0r5ZxPOJSjF2igorh4ZXlFOCajy0uyHTKIBT9g_aem_NrLB51a_1a4LAFRxuv50ZQ",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego.

We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

But in 2025-26, we need to do something more and different to win.  House parties can:\n\n- Reach voters outside of our political bubbles\n\n- Have friend and neighbor conversations with those who support our democratic values\n\n- Inoculate voters against the onslaught of right-wing media\n\n- Expand our volunteer base\n\n**Are you thinking about hosting a house party, but don't know how to get started?**  If you've never hosted one before (and even if you're a fellow introvert), or just want a refresher, join the Bay Area Coalition every Monday, 5 pm (PT) / 7 pm (CT) / 8 pm (ET) for our ** *nationwide* ** house party workshop ...\n\n - How to plan your house party\n\n - Tips and tools for hosting conversations with your friends, neighbors, colleagues\n\n*You'll leave the workshop fired up and ready to host your house party!*\n\nFor more Bay Area Coalition actions: https://bayareacoalition.org/",

    "description": "This week, Congress will hear the long-awaited federal voucher program in the US House Ways & Means Committee. The program, formerly known as “ECCA” and now called “Qualified Elementary and Secondary Education Scholarships,” would create a 100% tax break for the wealthy, allowing them to divert their taxes to support private education. Just like Arizona’s voucher program, this federal voucher would predominantly benefit students already attending (and already affording) private schools.\n\nJoin Save Our Schools Arizona for a No Federal Vouchers Power (Half) Hour. We'll get a brief overview on a national private school voucher program being pushed through the U.S. House this week and then we’ll call our US Senators & Representative and tell them to reject Federal vouchers!",

    "description": "Leaflet and talk with constituents of [R] Rep. Lawler in Tarrytown, in the purple district of NY17 about the very unpopular budget/reconciliation bill that would cut trillions from Medicaid, and much more so that billionaires could get trillions in tax cuts. If Rep. Lawler gets lots of calls telling him to vote against this budget bill, it is possible to defeat it. The Republicans majority in the House is so small that the loss of Lawler's vote could kill it. We'll be meeting at Grand Central Station [information kiosk] at 9:30am to take a Metro North train to Tarrytown [arriving at 10:39am]. We'll have leaflets and wear signs \"No Cuts to Medicaid\" and \"Billionaires Do Not Need Tax Cuts\". We'll be approaching people in high traffic areas with leaflets and talk to them about this Tax Scam budget, urge them to phone Rep. Lawler and tell them about local actions planned by local groups that we work with. \n\n\nSwing Left is a grassroots organization that helps people make an impact in the elections that determine the national balance of power in the country. Our goal is simple: elect Democrats to help strengthen our democracy.",

Central Ave, Ste J (downstairs), Valley City, ND. This location is more commonly known as the Straus Mall.\n\nAnd hey! Guess what! It costs you nothing to attend our meeting unlike another political party that actually charges their members for their attendance. Heck, we will even offer you coffee and water for free!\n\nOur Democratic Party stands for working families, rescuing our economy not just in the short run, but to rebuild it for the LONG run. We support public education, fair and equitable tax structures and accessible health care for all. But that is not all! Come join us and learn how you can make a difference in these days of near dictatorship.",

    "description": "We've heard the talk from Trump and Elon, that our government is TOO BIG, SO FULL OF FRAUD AND WASTE, and the only cure for this is to take a gilded chainsaw to it and cut it down to size in order to lower taxes. Enter DOGE and the tech bros combing through our personal data firing government employees. \n\nDoes this actually work for us? Will it benefit working class people by making these services more reliable and economical? Spoiler alert: IT WILL NOT!\n\nJoin us for our 5-part community discussion series titled \"Privatization is THEFT!\" where we explore what government's responsibility is to it's people, how they've traditionally done that, and what happens when public services go into private corporate hands to be run as efficiently as possible, like a business. \n\nWe will culminate our series with attendance at the June 14th NO KINGS rally being held in Albany, for those that can make it. \n\nSession 1: Wednesday May 14th - Intro to The Privatization of Public Goods.\nSession 2: Wednesday May 21st - The Privatization of Healthcare.\nSession 3: Wednesday May 28th - The Privatization of Education and Childcare.\nSession 4: Wednesday June 11th - What's Next - Who owns the Water?\nSession 5: Saturday June 14th - Putting it into Practice at the NO KINGS Rally.",

But we also need local, more frequent rallies that show locals that they're not alone in this fight.\n \n[So we made one](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisible/event/775717). And six weeks later, we've made a second one, and you're invited to attend!\n\nEvery Wednesday, @ 7am, we'll gather at Serafina Coffee Roasters on 7th St & Coral Gables to grab a beverage, walk across the parking lot to the sidewalk, and show the busy morning commuters that they are not alone.\n\nPeak traffic time seems to be from 7:30 to 8:30a. Yes, it's already hot in Phoenix, so plan accordingly. \n\nSpread the word. Come join us. Or start your own!\n\nAll the details you need are at [RhRR.us](https://rhrr.us).\n\nLove this idea and [want to start your own Rush-hour Resistance Rally in your area](https://rhrr.us/#start-your-own)? Groovy! Let's make that happen!",

    "description": "NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. In Willits we are meeting at Babcock Park at 10:00 and then parading down Main Street to Bud Snider Park on Commercial Street.  Some that do not want to walk will go to Bud Snider Park.  We will have cars available along the route if someone tires.  Please bring your signs, water, hat or umbrella and snacks if you choose.  We will provide rides back to Babcock Park if needed. \n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

Its primary purpose is to prevent foreign influence and corruption of U.S. officials.\n\nThe ultimate Trump grift = accepting a $400 million Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, a Flying Palace, from the Qatari royal family.\nWe know Trump can't be bothered to read the Constitution or understand the oath he took to the Office of the Presidency, and if MAGA Republican lawmakers allow this grift, it tells us what they think of the Constitution.\n\nJoin us at noon on May 23rd at the Williamsburg James City County Courthouse, located at 5201 Monticello Avenue, Williamsburg, with your signs, and a chair if necessary, to let our community know what you think about this and all the other times Trump has ignored the Constitution and American Norms.\n\nIt will be hot so please, do not forget a cold beverage and dress appropriately for the weather - maybe a hat or umbrella.\n\nAs with our previous events, the same rules apply. We will not engage with counter-protesters. If an issue arises, please notify one of the event organizers, who will be wearing Williamsburg JCC Indivisible t-shirts. We will not engage in any acts of violence or violation of any applicable laws or engage in civil disobedience. All actions will be peaceful. Everyone participating in this event will be required to behave lawfully to ensure the safety of event participants and will seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. We will obey the orders of authorized event marshals and law enforcement authorities. Event organizers will not be responsible for any injury or damage if any were to occur during this event. We will park in the Courthouse parking lot without blocking access lanes and will remove any trash that is left. We are committed to maintaining public health measures to practice safe protesting during these times. Please wear a mask and socially distance if that makes you more comfortable - weigh your own risk in attending. Follow all local safety guidelines at minimum, and any safety instructions from hosts that exceed local law.",

    "description": "Trump wants a military parade. We’re giving him a history lesson.\n\nOn June 14, while Trump spends millions of taxpayer dollars celebrating his own birthday with tanks and pageantry, Indivisible Woodstock CAN will join communities across the country for No Kings—a national day of action against authoritarianism and billionaire corruption.\n\nFlag Day isn’t about glorifying a man. It marks the birth of the U.S. Army—the day our nation first stood up to a king. Now Trump wants to twist that legacy into a monument to himself. We’re here to say: No Thrones. No Crowns. No Kings.\n\n✊ WHY WE’RE MOBILIZING\nThis isn’t just political disagreement. It’s a coordinated power grab.\n\nHe’s using our tax dollars to throw his party—while they slash Social Security and gut Medicaid.\n\nHe’s defied courts, disappeared people, and threatened dissenters.\n\nHe’s pushing for a third term and building a machine to rule, not govern.\n\nWe’re done being quiet. We’re done pretending this is normal.\nThis is our country, and we’re showing up to defend it.\n\n🎖️ WHO THIS IS FOR\nWhether you’re a veteran who took the oath…\nA parent worried about your child’s future…\nOr a neighbor who just knows this isn’t right…\n\nThis moment is for you.\nCome stand with us in visible, nonviolent resistance. Let’s show the country what real patriotism looks like.\n\n🔔 WHAT TO EXPECT\nPeaceful rally and sidewalk demonstration—we’ll stay on sidewalks and paved areas and will not block traffic or pedestrians.\n\nSpeakers including veterans and community members\n\nA first aid/shade tent nearby\n\nSigns, chants, flags, and a united front against corruption\n\n🧭 WHAT TO BRING & WEAR\nWear red, white, and blue\n\nIf you’ve served or are currently serving, feel free to wear military attire\n\nBring water, sunscreen, and a sign if you’ve got one\n\n🛡️ OUR COMMUNITY GUIDELINES\nStay peaceful and nonviolent\n\nDo not bring weapons (even legally permitted ones)\n\nDo not engage with agitators or counter-protesters\n\nFollow the lead of our trained volunteers and coordinators\n\nKeep public areas accessible and safe for all\n\nThis is a nationwide mobilization to reject strongman rule and stand up for the people. We’re not spectators. We’re the story.\n\n\nHOSTED BY:\nIndivisible Woodstock CAN\n📧 woodstockcan@proton.me\n📣 Instagram: @indivisiblewoodstockcan\n🌐 www.woodstockcan.com",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego.

We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

    "description": "Trump wants a military parade. We’re giving him a history lesson.\n\nOn June 14, while Trump spends millions of taxpayer dollars celebrating his own birthday with tanks and pageantry, Indivisible Woodstock CAN will join communities across the country for No Kings—a national day of action against authoritarianism and billionaire corruption.\n\nFlag Day isn’t about glorifying a man. It marks the birth of the U.S. Army—the day our nation first stood up to a king. Now Trump wants to twist that legacy into a monument to himself. We’re here to say: No Thrones. No Crowns. No Kings.\n\n✊ WHY WE’RE MOBILIZING\nThis isn’t just political disagreement. It’s a coordinated power grab.\n\nHe’s using our tax dollars to throw his party—while they slash Social Security and gut Medicaid.\n\nHe’s defied courts, disappeared people, and threatened dissenters.\n\nHe’s pushing for a third term and building a machine to rule, not govern.\n\nWe’re done being quiet. We’re done pretending this is normal.\nThis is our country, and we’re showing up to defend it.\n\n🎖️ WHO THIS IS FOR\nWhether you’re a veteran who took the oath…\nA parent worried about your child’s future…\nOr a neighbor who just knows this isn’t right…\n\nThis moment is for you.\nCome stand with us in visible, nonviolent resistance. Let’s show the country what real patriotism looks like.\n\n🔔 WHAT TO EXPECT\nPeaceful rally and sidewalk demonstration—we’ll stay on sidewalks and paved areas and will not block traffic or pedestrians.\n\nSpeakers including veterans and community members\n\nA first aid/shade tent nearby\n\nSigns, chants, flags, and a united front against corruption\n\n🧭 WHAT TO BRING & WEAR\nWear red, white, and blue\n\nIf you’ve served or are currently serving, feel free to wear military attire\n\nBring water, sunscreen, and a sign if you’ve got one\n\n🛡️ OUR COMMUNITY GUIDELINES\nStay peaceful and nonviolent\n\nDo not bring weapons (even legally permitted ones)\n\nDo not engage with agitators or counter-protesters\n\nFollow the lead of our trained volunteers and coordinators\n\nKeep public areas accessible and safe for all\n\nThis is a nationwide mobilization to reject strongman rule and stand up for the people. We’re not spectators. We’re the story.\n\nHOSTED BY:\nIndivisible Woodstock CAN\n📧 woodstockcan@proton.me\n📣 Instagram: @indivisiblewoodstockcan\n🌐 www.woodstockcan.com",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego.

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

Refusing to show IDs and warrants, a crowd of mostly women thought their neighbor was being kidnapped and bravely confronted the brutal take down. \n\nIt’s time to put our own bodies on the line and say ENOUGH. Enough to Gestapo-like tactics. Enough to racist targetting. White people have a particular responsibility in this time: to step up and stand alongside our immigrant neighbors.\n\nJoin us for a mass call to learn more about how you can show up in your own community. \n\nThen stick around immediately after to take coordinated online action with our Action Hour crew for our community members that have been kidnapped, detained, and deported by ICE.

    "description": "For decades, Southern California has suffered from some of the most polluted air in the country. The fossil fuel industry is actively working to weaken and delay critical clean air rules that would help move homes off the dirty fossil fuels that drive this pollution.  \n\nWith unprecedented federal attacks on climate science and the gutting of federal protections for clean air and water, we need our local representatives to fill the leadership void. \n\n📅 Join us to rally for clean air on Friday, June 6 at 8 a.m. to tell the South Coast Air Quality Management District: Pass strong rules, no more delays, no more weakening.\n\nAfter the rally, you can make a public comment at the 9 a.m. SCAQMD board meeting to tell the board why you want clean, healthy air and climate action now.",

In the summertime, blood donations significantly drop off despite the needs increasing. The committee is asking people in our network to either donate blood or volunteer to help at the collections.\n\t\t\nThis is the second blood drive that the Committee has done.  The committee needs your help making this year's drive successful. Please ask people in your network to donate blood and consider volunteering to help the day of the event.\n\t\t\nThe committee has a limited number of time slots; if you wish to donate, sign up online. Thank you for considering giving the gift of life with your blood donation. It's relatively painless (just a quick \"prick\") and fast, and you'll feel great donating at a time when the Red Cross faces such a critical shortage.",

Thank you for voting during primaries and for voting “down ballot” – voting for the local offices that have the most immediate impact on our everyday lives. BUT, did you know that a dismal 49% of NY voters participated in the last presidential election?\n \nThe Action Group NYC and Eleanor Roosevelt Independent Democratic Club are hosting a postcard writing initiative to send heartfelt messages to voters who sit out primary and midterm elections.  We've got a very important primary coming up on June 24th and some folks don't even know this is happening! \n\nJoin us on Tuesday, May 20th, 6 - 8 pm, 12 Grammercy Park South, as we gather together in a cozy townhouse and write messages that aim to rebuild our fragmented community.  Slow and steady, we can make the difference!\n \nYour personal encouragement goes a long way towards reminding New Yorkers of the power of their voice to make a difference, that speaking up and voting is the utmost form of activism.",

    "description": "In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.\n\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t — to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.\n\nJoin us at the intersection of Olde Waterford Way and Route 17 Southbound (400–448 Olde Waterford Way, Leland, NC 28451) between the hours of 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM on Saturday June 14th. Please park in the public parking areas near Harris Teeter just behind the intersection.\n\nThis is considered a \"stationery march\" where you will stand on the grass just off Route 17 at Olde Waterford Way and the traffic will pass you by. Your job is to be visible. Make yourself be seen. Our aim is to be respectful, safe and considerate of motorists passing us by. There will be representatives from the 2 sponsoring organizations – Indivisible Defenders of Democracy and Indivisible Wilmington.\n\nCome prepared. Bring a backpack with food and water, sunscreen, sunglasses, a hat and an umbrella in case of rain or to block the sun. Bring a chair too to sit a spell when you get tired. And of course bring a sign to let motorists know how you feel. The theme is No Kings.\n\nINDIVISIBLE DEFENDERS OF DEMOCRACY\n\nINDIVISIBLE WILMINGTON\n\nBRUNSWICK INDIVISIBLE STEPPING FORWARD FOR ACTION",

    "description": "You are an amazing group! All heroes in our eyes! We have news about TWO events! Yes TWO! So read carefully! The site and time will be the same, the dates will be different. So on Saturday May 31st we will gather at 147th and the East side of LaGrange Road in Orland Park at 11am until 1pm. This is a peaceful protest. Please do not engage with any counter protesters.  Some do not like this approach but we have found it to be the most successful way of having our voices heard and enjoying the community we have developed. There will be monitors on site if a de-escalation is needed.  On Saturday the 14th of June we will gather at the above mentioned place and same time for NO KINGS DAY. We know there are bigger venues but feel that some of our  most vulnerable that cannot make those trips have the same opportunity as everyone. We get people from nearby and far away! We post on many platforms so we do draw a great mix of people! On some platforms we are South Suburban Relentless and also Protect Our Rights.  Our last protest had a head count of over 100 and I heard one of our group say there were 150 supporters of OUR RGHTS that attended! Ten, Fifty or Hundreds, we are all fighting the good fight and on the right side of history.  As always bring a chair if you need a break. Bring water and friends! See you there! When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty! Kathy and Sharon.",

    "description": "NO KINGS Marin - Part of a county-wide mobilization\n\nIn America, we don’t put up with would-be kings. NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies.\n\nOn June 14th Marin County says No Thrones! No Crowns! No Kings! Local citizen action groups are working together to organize a coordinated, county-wide day of NO KINGS action against the Trump regime.\n\nEvents will pop up at the same time highly visible locations throughout Marin. Together and all at once, we will show our strength in numbers, build our movement, and send a loud and clear message that Marin stands together against rising authoritarianism and a wannabe King.\n\nMore Marin events will be added in coming days and weeks. Sign up to attend the action for this location or check back soon to find additional locations.\n\nNOTE: Location and time of this event is subject to change as we determine the specifics of the event\n\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. All participants agree to assume 100% responsibility for their own safety, conduct and well-being.",
