We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire cronies.\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re demonstrating out in public nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\n\nCheck out [nokings.org](https://www.nokings.org/) for more information. \n\nThe No Kings Minnetonka-Southwest Metro demonstration is sponsored by Indivisible MN03. Indivisible MN03 is made up of people across the political spectrum who gathered to oppose Donald Trump and his enablers from 2017 to the present. We believe that no one is above the law and every American has a right to have elected officials who are accountable to the people under the Constitution. \n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*\n\nAll local protests organized by Indivisible MN03 are peaceful, legal, nonviolent, family-friendly exercises of first amendment rights in public places.",

The traffic will be manageable and parking easier to find. We'll have community groups with tables set up around the Plaza by noon, and perhaps a station where you can make your protest signs. Watch this space, our social media and our newsletters for more details.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",

Along with our protests we will be presenting our concerns in person & delivering identical letters to them.\n\nThough we have many issues with this bill, our focus Thursday is on protecting Medicaid, ie NO CUTS to MEDICAID or SNAP in order to give massive tax breaks to corporations & the ultra rich. If you can, please bring signs that promote this theme. We will also have extras on hand.\n\nWe’ll meet at Capito’s office at 300 Foxcroft Ave. Martinsburg at 10:00 am. We plan to be there for about 50 minutes, then moving to Moore’s office at 739 Winchester Ave until noon.\n\nBerkeley Springs folks can carpool by meeting at the Black Cat Music Shop at 8:45, leaving at 9:00.\n\n💥Bring your SPIRIT, your VOICE, a FRIEND, & a SIGN!💥\n                   There will be extra signs on hand.\n\nReminder: We need to be aware of pedestrians and traffic on the streets. We need to keep sidewalks accessible and not interfere with traffic. At Riley Moore’s office we need to be on the sidewalk, not up on the step. Everyone's safety is important.\n\n**Please note** A core principle behind our actions is a commitment to nonviolence in all we do.",

    "description": "Join us for our 12th consecutive rally to Defend Democracy in beautiful downtown Bethel. While our overall theme is Defending Democracy, each week we pick a specific focus. On Saturday May 24th, 11am -12:30pm, our focus will be on Supporting Military Families’ Service and Sacrifice. \n\nWe will be honoring the service and sacrifice of the members of our active duty Armed Forces and their families.  As it is Memorial Day Weekend we will also be paying tribute to those who paid the ultimate price in service to this country.  \n\nWe will highlight some of the issues military families face including food insecurity, obtaining mental health services for the service member and their spouse, and cuts in experienced high ranking officers leaving troops without appropriate leadership.\n\nVietnam veteran John Paul Trudeau, who experienced firsthand, the loss of friends and brothers in arms, will be our guest speaker.\n\nSeveral live musical selections will be performed by Barry Saroff.  Lorraine McGuire will lead a sing-a-long of God Bless America.\n\nThe rally is non-partisian. All are welcome.\n\nThere will be something for everyone. We'll have speakers, we'll rally with our signs, we'll take a short march and we'll have live music. We also like to end each week with a sing-a-long.\n\nA sign-making table will also be available, complete with all the necessary supplies, for young and old to make signs for the rally.\n\nWe also collect a non-perishable food item for our local food pantry each week.  Some special requests from the food pantry:\n\n-  Spices, Coffee and Baking supplies are always needed.\n\n-   Individually packaged items. so if you bought a variety pack of something like granola bars or instant oatmeal and discovered there's a flavor you won't eat, please give us the individual packs out of box.\n\n-  Empty egg cartons- Any style, so long as they're clean.\n\n-  SMALL empty detergent bottles\n\nNote: Rally is rain or shine.\n\nThere are 2 small benches at the square and we will have a limited number of camping chairs. Please bring your own lawn or camping chair if you'd like.\n\nWe also ask that you park at one of the four public parking lots. The lot that is very close to the rally location, PT Barnum Square, is behind the municipal center.  A map will be emailed to you after registration.\n\nAlthough all street parking is public, we ask that you please do not park in the limited parking spots in front of our local businesses, but definitely enjoy our beautiful towns restaurants and shops after the rally! \nThank you 😊",

    "description": "\"No Kings Since 1776\" - Standing Against Autocracy\n\nJoin us on July 5th for a peaceful march and rally to reaffirm our commitment to democratic principles and stand against the threats of autocracy. As we gather just after Independence Day, we honor our founders' revolutionary spirit and their rejection of monarchical rule.\n\nWhy July 5th?\n\nWhile the nation celebrates on the 4th, we gather the day after to remind ourselves that independence isn't just a historical achievement—it's an ongoing responsibility. Just as the revolutionaries of 1776 declared \"No More Kings,\" we continue their legacy by standing vigilant against autocratic tendencies in our own time.\n\nWhat to Bring:\n\n- Signs (suggested themes: democratic values, checks and balances, \"No Kings Since 1776\")\n- Water and sun protection\n- Your commitment to peaceful democratic action\n\nThis non-partisan event welcomes all who believe in preserving democratic institutions and opposing autocratic governance, regardless of political affiliation.\n\nLocation: TBA",

    "description": "Dear friends and fellow Democrats,\n\nWe’re thrilled to invite you to join the Multnomah County Democrats in celebrating the annual Mississippi Street Fair, a fantastic event commemorating historic Mississippi Avenue and its extensive contributions to the fabric of Portland, Oregon. The event takes place on Saturday, July 12th, and is a powerful opportunity for us to see each other in person, engage with our community, show off our Democratic pride, and enjoy one of the wonderful neighborhoods of our dynamic city!\n\nAt the event, we’ll be engaging in some of the important work that Multnomah County Democrats do all year; registering new voters, discussing our efforts locally and statewide, and signing up other volunteers! If this sounds like something you’d like to be a part of, then come join us and help make a difference in our community!\n\n# Event Time\n\n**Saturday July 12th, 2025**\n\n_10:00 AM - 9:00 PM_\n\n[Mississippi Avenue Street Fair](https://mississippiave.org/streetfair/)\n\n# Location\n\n**Mississippi Ave. between N Fremont & Skidmore**\n\nLet’s show up and make our voices and presence heard and felt, and have the biggest MultDems contingent we can muster available at the fair! We’ll be talking with other members of our community and showing everyone the strength of our values and our community spirit. And we’ll have a great time in the sunshine doing it!\n\nDon’t forget to wear your MultDems gear if you have it, and after your volunteer shift, stick around for the full street fair, and all the wonderful community members and attractions it has to offer! It’s a great way to meet and get to know other progressive members of our fair city, and to enjoy all of the excellent vendors that make up historic Mississippi Avenue.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you there as we come together to represent our Democratic values, connect with our community, and enjoy our city!\n\nIn solidarity,\n\n**[Multnomah County Democrats](https://multdems.org/)**",

    "description": "PLEASE READ COMPLETELY before attending!\n\nThis is a peaceful, nonviolent protest on the sidewalk in front of the Stanford Tesla showroom. There will be theatrics and dancing. Get ready to improv! We'll also be looping through Stanford Shopping Mall with peaceful positive energy. Of course you may opt out and continue to demonstrate in front of the Tesla showroom. \n\nWe know making lots of noise is typically part of a good protest. But most protests aren’t right across the street from a Ronald McDonald House. Let’s take care to keep our noise levels down to a dull roar. Bring your energy and spirit, but let’s refrain from the cowbells, drums and car honks. We can get our point across without interfering with our neighbors on the other side of the road.\n\nWear your favorite wig, big hat, or costume. We want to have fun and to feel like a party during our demonstrations! Signs, flags, and similar items are welcome.\n\nThis is a peaceful demonstration, and any conflicts or altercations will not be tolerated. Walk away if one arises and report it to the demonstration leader on site if it is a serious altercation. We will comply with requests from the police and mall security, including if we are asked to leave. By the way, we have already have a fantastic relationship with mall security, which is a plus!\n\nDo not boo or confront Tesla drivers or cars, or Tesla employees. Remember that most Tesla drivers are our allies, and many are protesting with us!\n\nPlease Note: Photos may be taken and published at this event, including by attendees and professional photographers. If you prefer not to have your image captured or shared, please take your own precautions (e.g., wear a mask, hat, or wig).\n\n#BoycottTesla #DivestFromTesla",

    "description": "Indivisible Cumberland County welcomes Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows for a public discussion on election integrity. Bellows will speak about her role in protecting Maine’s elections, including her 2023 decision to bar former President Donald Trump from Maine’s primary ballot under the 14th Amendment’s insurrection clause—a decision later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. She will also discuss her office’s ongoing work to increase election transparency, including livestreaming ballot tabulations and educating voters on Maine’s ranked-choice voting process.\n\nBellows will also address the proposed November referendum that would impose new photo ID requirements and restrict absentee voting by eliminating two days of early voting, limiting drop boxes, and tightening absentee ballot requests. She has raised concerns that these changes could create barriers for seniors, rural voters, and others who rely on current absentee voting options. The event offers attendees the chance to learn more about these proposed changes and ask questions about Maine’s efforts to ensure secure and accessible elections.",

We will meet at 1:30 pm at the corner of 5th Ave and E 43rd St. Bring signs, wear your Brad swag, and come ready to march and yell!\n\nFrom No Kings organizers:\n\nIn America, we don’t put up with would-be kings. NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",

We reject authoritarianism and embrace the democratic ideals that soldiers have fought to defend for generations.\n\nYet today, those ideals are under threat. The growing concentration of power, dangerous rhetoric, and attacks on our freedoms make it clear: We must say NO to kings.\n\n🗳️ That starts right here at home. Local leaders are our first line of defense against national overreach. Who we elect to school boards, city councils, and state legislatures matters.\n\n📢 Join us in Bowling Green on the corner of Main & Wooster for a powerful, peaceful protest to demand accountability, defend democracy, and raise our voices for a government that works for the people—not above them.\n\n💙 Can’t attend? You can still help fight for democracy at the local level:\n👉 Donate here: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vote-local2025\n\nThis event is sponsored by the Wood County Democratic Party and Ohio 50501.",

    "description": "## Set-Up Crew\n\nThis sign-up is **ONLY** for the **SET-UP CREW** for Juneteenth Black Arts Festival. \n\nSet-Up Includes **TWO PARTS:**\n\n**1. Pick-Up Equipment** - Sometime **the week of June 16 - June 20,** pick up the tent, table, chairs, and other equipment from CCDP's office in the Food Lion Shopping Center, in Pittsboro near the urgent care. Call the CEC at 919-704-8669 to confirm hours and/or get directions, or visit the website at ccdpnc.org. \n\nIt's most convenient if you have an SUV or a truck to transport the materials, but a small SUV works well, and a large sedan with trunk space works too.\n\n**2. Set Up Site** - Arrive at the Juneteenth Black Arts Festival site at the Chatham County Fairgrounds in Pittsboro by 2:30 pm on Saturday, June 21, unload all of the equipment, and set up the CCDP tent. \n\n[Download this PDF that tells you everything you need to know about setting up a CCDP tent event!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/166H68VYdekt4POF1CXZYRR0mdMTQy0yN/view?usp=sharing)\n\nTo **join the take-down crew** on Saturday, June 21 at 8 pm: [Sign Up Here](https://www.mobilize.us/chathamcountydems/event/791751/)\n \nTo **take a shift** working at the tent: [Sign Up Here](https://www.mobilize.us/chathamcountydems/event/791658/)",

    "description": "Rally With America’s Veterans\nAmerica made a promise to its veterans. It's a promise we intend to keep.\nOn June 6th, join thousands of veterans, military families, and their allies across the country and on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., for the Unite for Veterans, Unite for America Rally. We will have a local event in Greene Co, Ohio in solidarity with the DC event. It will be from 4-6pm at in Beavercreek. Register to attend and for information. \n\nWe are coming together to defend the benefits, jobs, and dignity that every generation of veterans has earned through sacrifice.\n\nVeteran jobs, healthcare, and essential VA services are under attack. We will not stand by.\n\nWhy We Rally from Unite For Veterans\n\nVeterans and military family members are being fired by the thousands from federal jobs. Our healthcare is being gutted. Our benefits are under siege.\n\nThis isn't the first time veterans have had to fight for what was promised. From the Bonus Army of 1932 to the battles for the GI Bill and Agent Orange care, veterans have always led the charge for justice.\n\nNow, it's our turn.\n\nWe rally to:\n\nDefend veteran and military family member employment in the federal workforce\n\nStop the privatization and weakening of the Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nHold political leaders accountable for policies that harm veterans and their families",

    "description": "Join with other Cass County DFL volunteers to help build a house for a deserving family. With Habitat for Humanity (HFH) houses under construction in Cass County from Pillager to Cass Lake, we have volunteered to build on the second Thursday of every month. We’ll provide the specific location to those signed up a few days in advance of the work day. (Contact Marty Cook at 218 513-3939 if you have questions.)\n\nWork days will typically run from 9:00-4:00. The HFH supervisor and construction manager will teach us everything we need to know.  There will be a short briefing before we begin working to explain everything. Tools will be provided, but if you want to bring your favorite hammer and/or tool belt, feel free to do that.  (Make sure you label them with your name).\n\nHFH asks that you complete the volunteer form on the Lakes Area Habitat for Humanity website https://www.lakesareahabitat.org/volunteer/volunteer-form/ in advance of our work day if you have not already done so. (There will be forms you can complete when you get there, if you forget).\n\nPrepare for the day:\n\n    Dress for the weather, but don't wear loose fitting clothes\n    Wear closed toe and heel shoes or work boots\n    Wear your Cass County DFL t-shirt (or get one on the work day for having volunteered!)\n    Bring work gloves or garden gloves if you have them\n\nCass County DFL will provide drinks and lunch.",

In Maryland, we'll be using this grassroots pressure tactic to understand Governor Wes Moore's position on gas plants in Maryland and to push to keep new gas plants out of Maryland. \n\nDuring the training, you'll learn how to identify a good event, how to formulate a question to your official, how to carry out the birddog, and what next steps to take after getting a response. We hope to see you there!",

    "description": "On June 6, 2025, veterans, patriots, and supporters will gather in Houston under the banner of 50501-Houston to honor the legacy of D-Day and to protest in defense of the U.S. Constitution, stand up for veterans' rights, and demand full support for those who have served.\n\nThe rally will call on the Federal Government to rehire wrongfully terminated employees and to fully fund and implement the PACT Act, a historic piece of legislation that directly affects the health and well-being of veterans exposed to toxic substances during military service.\n\n“This is more than a protest—it’s a movement of accountability and unity,” organizers said. “We stand for the Constitution, we stand for veterans, and we will not be silent.”\n\nWhat Is the PACT Act?\nThe Sergeant First Class (SFC) Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act is the most significant expansion of VA health care and benefits in decades. It ensures that veterans exposed to toxic substances—including burn pits, Agent Orange, and radiation—receive the care and compensation they deserve.\n\nKey Provisions of the PACT Act Include:\n\nExpanded eligibility for VA health care for veterans of Vietnam, Gulf War, and post-9/11 eras\n\n20+ new “presumptive conditions” linked to toxic exposure\n\nAutomatic coverage for conditions like cancers and respiratory illnesses\n\nRequired toxic exposure screenings for all enrolled veterans\n\nAdditional funding for VA research, staffing, and treatment systems\n\nVeterans are encouraged to file claims now and check their eligibility for new or expanded benefits under this law.\n\nWhy This Matters:\nTens of thousands of veterans are affected by toxic exposures. Without full funding and government follow-through, the promises made by the PACT Act could fall short. That’s why 50501-Houston is calling on all Americans to unite on June 6—to honor those who fought for freedom and fight now for those living with the aftermath of service.",

Our benefits are under siege.\n\nThis isn't the first time veterans have had to fight for what was promised. From the Bonus Army of 1932 to the battles for the GI Bill and Agent Orange care, veterans have always led the charge for justice.\n\nNow, it's our turn.\n\nWe rally to:\n\nDefend veteran and military family member employment in the federal workforce\n\nStop the privatization and weakening of the Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nHold political leaders accountable for policies that harm veterans and their families",

Also there is a dirt path to the shelter- it is not paved. \nThere is no public restroom- just a port a potty. The nearest restroom is a block up at the Lariat.\n\n\n**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen.

    "description": "Join us for our next statewide meeting where we'll focus on our work that's happening outside of the metro Boston area. This topic suggestion came from direct member feedback that folks wanted to see a clearer picture and connection between what's happening statewide, versus just in Boston proper, where legislation is happening. We'll hear from Peter McConarty, based in the Worcester area; Robin Neipp in Western MA; and special guests \nHeather Shruhan, Senior Director of the Safe Corners street outreach program through the Old Colony YMCA in Brockton and Juliana Badaro, Gun Violence Prevention Coalition Coordinator, Old Colony YMCA Safe Corners. Come with your questions and suggestions for how you can get involved in our work throughout the state. See you there! \n\"",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\r\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\r\n\r\n\r\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\r\n\r\n\r\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\r\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\r\n\r\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "**Join The Salmonberry Trail in our exciting ground breaking event at Waterfront Park in Wheeler!**\n\nThe City of Wheeler is excited to announce that we are taking the first steps toward revitalization of Wheeler’s section of the Salmonberry Trail through partnership with the Salmonberry Trail Foundation and Tillamook Coast Visitors Association. We will be holding a **Ground Building event and ceremony on July 12, 2025 from 1:00-5:00 PM.** We truly could not be more excited for the recreational opportunities this trail will provide for our community.\n\nThis transformative project holds the potential to deliver lasting, meaningful benefits to our community. By linking the Willamette Valley to the Coast, it will not only strengthen regional connectivity but also invigorate rural tourism and empower small businesses. It champions public health and safe, active transportation options while expanding equitable access to the outdoors for all residents. Most importantly, it lays the foundation for sustainable infrastructure that will support our economy, environment, and quality of life for generations to come.\n\nWe will have local vendors, music, games, and a ribbon cutting ceremony celebrating the beginning of this coastal section of the trail. \n- July 12th, 1PM - 5PM\n- Waterfront Park (500 Marine Dr, Wheeler, OR 97147)\n\n---\n**ABOUT THE SALMONBERRY TRAIL**\nThe Salmonberry Trail is an 82-mile multi-use path transforming a historic rail line into Oregon’s next big adventure. Connecting communities from the Willamette Valley to the coast, the trail will provide safe routes for recreation and education, expand economic opportunities, and improve public health. In partnership with local organizations, it will offer unique educational programs while promoting outdoor activity and conservation, making it a cornerstone of community development and environmental stewardship across the state.\n\n**Wheeler Demonstration Project – Salmonberry Trail**\nThe Wheeler Demonstration Project is a short, high-impact segment of the Salmonberry Trail located in downtown Wheeler. This 1,800-foot trail segment runs north from Rector Street, across Hemlock Street, and along the bay side of the Oregon Coast Scenic Railway tracks adjacent to Botts Marsh. It features a compacted gravel path for pedestrians, designed to enhance safety and encourage walking in the downtown area.\nDeveloped in partnership with the City of Wheeler, Oregon Coast Scenic Railway, Lower Nehalem Community Trust, and the Salmonberry Trail Foundation, the project supports local economic activity, offers environmental education through interpretive signage, and provides a model for similar efforts in other communities along the trail corridor.",

There is no task too big or too small. Even if you never come to a protest or a meeting you might be able to help us, but you won’t be able to help us. If you don’t know what we’re doing and what is going on. If you have not joined our discord channel by now, please message me so that you may join us in our conversations that we have on a daily basis throughout the day. We will be planning how to organize our group and who would like to take which tasks on. There are tasks that can be done from home. There are tasks that can be done in person. There is a task for everyone. It just depends on your skill set. Maybe you don’t think you have any talent but if you talk to me, I will help you determine your talents because I know you have them. I want to meet you and hope to see you soon. I especially hope that you will come to our event on May 25, which is a swap meet/potluck this Sunday.",

It's our solution that gives workers real power to fight back against wage theft and abuse.\n\n**📞 Join us May 21, May 29, or June 2 to blow up their phones and make it clear: NY must protect our paychecks.**\n\n** Let's pass the EmPIRE Act to protect our rights! **\n## **--> https://bit.ly/EmPIRECall**",

All those who sign up will be able to join us at the front.  We will have Disarm Hate tshirts for the first 20 people! We will also have buttons, stickers, and temporary Disarm Hate tattoos to all those who join! If you don't already have a Disarm Hate shirt, please wear purple, orange or black shirts!)\n\nYou will find exact guidance on where and when to meet, along with the timeline of the march once you sign up for the event, but expect the total march time, including getting to our place in line, to take about 2-3 hours. \n\nPride is always a great time - whether you are coming with friends or family - we encourage everyone to bring some friends along with you to enjoy the full festival, along with the parade. We look forward to seeing you at the event decked out in Orange and Rainbow and are excited to spread the word with you about the need to Disarm Hate!",

This is part of nationwide protests that day.\n\nBring a sign, if you're so inclined, and a lawn chair if you want to sit during the rally before we march. NO profanity on signs please.\n\nHope to see you there to support democracy. Encourage kindred spirits in your networks to join us. Copy/paste this text to ask them to put the event on their schedule.\n\nBring your siblings, your children, your parents, and your friends. There will be NO publicity prior to the event to minimize the chance of disruptors.\n\nRuston and north Louisiana need to know there are patriots who will stand up for our country's democracy. On flag day, we are taking back the flag from Jan 6 pseudo patriots!\n\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "NO KINGS Marin - Part of a county-wide mobilization \n\nIn America, we don’t put up with would-be kings. NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. \n\n On June 14th Marin County says No Thrones! No Crowns! No Kings! Local citizen action groups are working together to organize a coordinated, county-wide day of NO KINGS action against the Trump regime. \n\n Events will pop up at the same time highly visible locations throughout Marin. Together and all at once, we will show our strength in numbers, build our movement, and send a loud and clear message that Marin stands together against rising authoritarianism and a wannabe King. \n\nMore Marin events will be added in coming days and weeks. Sign up to attend the action for this location or check back soon to find additional locations. \n\n NOTE: Location and time of this event is subject to change as we determine the specifics of the event \n\nCheck out nokings.org for more information. \n\n A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. All participants agree to assume 100% responsibility for their own safety, conduct and well-being. \n\nThis event is being sponsored by MAP and Solidarity Sundays.",
