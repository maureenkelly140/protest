    "description": "As temperatures heat up and power bills rise, frustrated Georgians are starting to look at the Public Service Commission (PSC) for new regulations and to potentially bust up a Georgia Power monopoly.  Statewide PSC primaries for seats in Districts 2 and 3 will be held on June 17 and the general election will be on November 4.\n\nCoastal Georgia for Democracy, the Savannah Indivisible group for Georgia District 1, will host a live open forum for voters to ask the candidates questions about their positions in advance of the election. The event will be held at the Coastal Georgia Center, 305 Fahm Street, Savannah, on June 12 at 6:00pm.  The free event is open to the public.\n\nAll PSC candidates have been invited to appear and will answer voters’ questions regarding anything under the purview of the Public Service Commission, which includes how much Georgia residents pay for their electricity, landline telephones, and natural gas.  They also oversee the 811 “Call before you dig” line and items related to line interruptions when they are improperly monitored by contractors and residents. \n\nConfirmed attendees for the candidate forum include Alicia Blackstone in District 2 and Daniel Blackman, Peter Hubbard, Robert Jones, and Keisha Sean Waites in District 3.\n \nThe Georgia Public Service Commission has exclusive power to decide what are fair and reasonable rates for services under its jurisdiction. They must balance Georgia citizens' need for reliable services and reasonable rates with the need for utilities to earn a reasonable return on investment while not guaranteeing it. The Commission protects consumers' interests while abiding by legal standards in setting rates. All matters scheduled for public hearing are heard by the Commissioners or in special cases, by an appointed hearing officer in open session.\n\nCoastal Georgia for Democracy, a grassroots group of residents in the coastal Georgia region, is Savannah’s Indivisible group in Georgia’s District 1. We are committed to protecting democracy and promoting genuine equity and inclusion through progressive advocacy. We do not endorse candidates. We aim to defend and protect against attacks on constitutionally guaranteed freedoms, including safe and fair elections and the voting rights of citizens.

Mike Lawler, along with Jennifer Cabrera, an NY-17 constituent and chair of the Westchester-Putnam Chapter of the Working Families Party. In response to this incident, and other attempts to silence constituents, hundreds of NY-17 constituents will be rallying in Nyack to support Emily and other targets of Lawler’s intimidation, stand up for the Constitution, and highlight efforts by progressives to fight back against Rep.

    "description": "The chaos fueled by Trump’s authoritarian ambitions and Musk’s reckless influence can make the future feel bleak. But we’re not powerless and the numbers show just how close we are to taking back control. \n\nIn 2024, Democrats lost the House by 3 seats and just 7,309 votes total—the narrowest House majority in almost 100 years. \n\n**With such a narrow margin, winning the House is doable.** And it’s also the most impactful thing we can do to halt the destructive Trump, Musk, and Project 2025 agenda. While calling Congress and supporting lawsuits help to slow the bleeding, only elections will remove them from office. A House victory will give Democrats a critical federal lever: more power and more oversight to investigate government actions and political corruption, effectively stopping the MAGA legislative agenda in its tracks.\n\nWorking together, we can take a critical first step toward rebuilding democracy. **Join our gathering to connect, commiserate, and conspire– we’ll learn more about Swing Left’s strategy and make a plan to take action together.**",

    "description": "In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings. NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.\n\nThis is Indivisible Northern AZ's LOCAL event page, which is meant to reach people who have registered for one of our other events.  We are also registered on the NoKing.org website so that anyone can find this event on the map.  It is the SAME EVENT and you only need to register on one or the other links.\nYou will find more local details on this link.\nCo-sponsors of our local event will be announced soon and listed here.",

    "description": "Respect MO Voters and 50501 STL invite you to our SAVE OUR SAY Sit-In at the Gateway Arch. As Missouri legislators return home after undermining voter-approved amendments, we will gather to demand that our voices be heard and respected.\n\nFor over a century, Missourians have relied on the citizen initiative process to shape our state's laws. That process is now under attack.\nIn April, Governor Kehoe signed SB22, also known as the \"Let Politicians Lie Act.” This bill guts the initiative process, making it nearly impossible for everyday citizens to put measures on the ballot without political interference.\n\nWe are rallying to protect our democracy and support a proposed 2026 amendment that would:\n1-Ban politicians from overturning voter-approved amendments\n2-Protect the initiative process from added barriers\n3-Stop misleading ballot language that manipulates voters\n\nTogether, we will send a clear message: We, the people, have the final say.\n\nEvent Highlights\n\n ✨ Guest Speakers\n\n ✨ Petitions, voter registration, calls & letters\n\n ✨ “Hands Around the Arch” – Circle of Unity\n\n ✨ Family-friendly and peaceful\n\n Bring: Signs, voice, water, snacks, chair/blanket, and comfortable shoes.\n\n Meet: In the grassy field under the Arch, river-facing side.\n\n Parking: Nearby garages and street parking available.\n\n Note: Please do not block or congregate on sidewalks.",

Medicaid provides cradle-to-grave health care to Kentuckians, as well as community care for individuals with disabilities. It not only provides physical and mental health, but also economic health to providers, facilities and supporting businesses.\n Currently, 1.5 million Kentuckians–one third of all Kentuckians are covered by Medicaid. The cuts could result in the loss of coverage to 450,000 Kentuckians, at an economic loss of 3.8 billion dollars.

    "description": "A growing coalition of concerned citizens from across Pasco County-Pasco Resists- will gather on Friday, May 23, 2025, from 4:00-6:00PM at the West Pasco Government Center (8731 Citizens Dr, New Port Richey) to protest the erosion of democracy and honor America’s veterans in advance of Memorial Day.\n\nThe peaceful protest, titled “Democracy is Worth Fighting For,” will spotlight the ongoing dismissal and silencing of federal workers from critical agencies including the FAA, CDC, NIH, NIOSH, Veteran Affairs, Department of Education, HHS, IRS, FEMA, CFPB, USPS, NOAA, and USAID. Organizers argue that these actions represent a dangerous authoritarian turn in federal governance.\n\n“Veterans gave everything to defend our democracy, not to watch it be handed over to billionaires and felons who care more about profit and power than people,” said Doris Carroll, a retired nurse and community organizer. “We’re calling on everyday Americans to wake up, speak out, and stand up for the values this country was built on.”\n\nParticipants will carry signs, hear from guest speakers—including veterans, nurses, and civic leaders—and engage in a symbolic tribute to those who served in the U.S. Armed Forces. The event also condemns recent policy decisions that weaken environmental protections, public health infrastructure, and civil service integrity.\n\nThis protest is part of a wider movement that began in February, as citizens across the state and nation unite to oppose what organizers are calling a “bro-ligarchy”—a consolidation of power among wealthy elites that threatens the rule of law and constitutional governance.",

    "description": "In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings. NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out www.nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.\n\nThrough nonviolence, courage displaces fear; love transforms hate. Acceptance dissipates prejudice; hopes ends despair. Peace dominates war; faith reconciles doubt. Mutual regard cancels enmity.\n\nCome for the community connection - Everyone is welcome!",

    "description": "Our Minnetonka Wednesday Weekly Protest event is a peaceful, legal, nonviolent, family-friendly expression of first amendment rights. We will gather on the public sidewalks and grassy banks along the road margins at the intersection of Minnesota State Highway 7 and County Road 101 in Minnetonka where we will display our hand-made signs in view of evening rush hour traffic at a busy intersection. The convener is experienced in protesting at this location in all kinds of weather. The Highway 7 corridor includes communities with some of the highest voter turnout and civic engagement in the entire country. Residents here span the whole political spectrum of the United States of America, but we all agree that there are no kings in America. In between elections, we remind elected officials that no one is above the law and every elected official is accountable to the people under the Constitution. We affirm that American values of democracy, freedom, and rule of law and opposition to Trump's unaffordable policies are broadly supported in our community. \n\nThe Wednesday 14 May 2025 event is the second in a planned long series of Minnetonka Wednesday Weekly Protest events that will continue indefinitely on each Wednesday afternoon through summer, autumn, winter, and into next year as needed until further notice.",

But for too long, Ohio's school funding system has fallen short, creating an uneven playing field where some kids get more opportunities than others.\n\nThis isn't just about numbers; it's about justice. When we underfund our schools, it harms students, their families, and our community.  It denies them the resources students need to thrive and have access to all the opportunities they deserve. \n\nAt this town hall, we will:\n\n* **Learn** how state funding decisions are impacting our schools. \n* **Expose** how the current system perpetuates educational and economic disparities.\n* **Share** to tell our stories.\n* **Organize** to build a powerful movement of parents, students, and community members who won't settle for anything less than equity.\n\nIt's time to rewrite the narrative. Let's demand that our lawmakers fully fund the Fair School Funding Plan, a solution that takes into account the actual needs of each district.  Our kids are counting on us to build a future where their zip code doesn't determine their destiny.",

    "description": "Join us for an all-day training that will provide you with the skills and practice to help de-escalate violence, be a better marshal at protests and rallies, and even explore opportunities to join the Meta Peace Team as a regular volunteer. \n\nThe Meta Peace Team has been training and deploying Peace Teams domestically and internationally since 1993.  They are currently sending teams to Palestine and the US Mexico Border, and are on call to be a calming presence to help prevent violence at protests and rallies.\n\nThis training has a suggested donation of $85 per person to compensate the Meta Peace Team trainers (more if you can help us cover lunch, less if you can't even afford the $85 - nobody will be turned away due to lack of funds) .  Crowded Table Coalition will be providing lunch, and will gladly accept any donations in excess of the $85 to cover that expense as well.\n\nDescription from Meta Peace Team (https://www.metapeaceteam.org/our-next-nonviolence-skills-training):\n\nIn this 8-hour workshop, participants will explore nonviolence in the \"big picture\"; what it means, how it is used, and how good-hearted, well-intentioned people can disagree yet still work together. You will learn and gain practice in specific skills and tools that are useful both in conflict intervention situations and in daily life, including:\n\n- Active Listening\n- The Importance of Body Language\n- Personal Power Messages\n- The CLARA technique\n\nYou will be introduced to tools for group work (Affinity Teams and consensus decision making) and to the concept of “peace teams” or third-party nonviolent intervention (TPNI) and its scope of possibilities, including Unarmed Civilian Protection (UCP). You will learn the finer points of compassionate Bystander Intervention.  And finally, you will learn about the work of MPT and how they can get involved if they want to.",

    "description": "Alliance San Diego and We Are CA are joining the California Teachers Association, and educators in San Diego for a statewide action to stand up for students and defend public education!\n\nDismantling the Department of Education, laying off thousands of dedicated department of education staff, appointing someone who has never spent a day teaching in a classroom to be our Secretary of Education…these are more than just headlines. They are direct threats to public education and the future of students and families across our community.\n\nThe Trump Administration is betraying public-school students and educators. Education is a non-partisan issue. Students in poverty and students with special needs deserve resources and support in our schools – we can all agree on that. The Trump Administration is targeting students and families in our communities with these vicious plans to dismantle public education. It’s unacceptable and we’re fighting back. \n\nDetails:\n\nStart: Saturday, May 17, 2025 at 11:00 AM\n\nStarting Location: Roosevelt Middle School, 3366 Park Boulevard, San Diego CA 92103\n\nThe event will include a march and a short program of local educators and community leaders who are parents in area public schools.\n\nMore Parking and Public Transit info: Free parking is available throughout Balboa Park, with detailed information available on the park’s website, and street parking throughout the North Park neighborhood. Participants wishing to use public transit should plan specific routes in advance using the MTS Trip Planner.",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide, including in Columbus. March with Indivisible Central Ohio at Columbus Pride! Lineup for the march begins at 8:30 am at Broad & High in downtown Columbus, with step-off at 10:30 am.**🚨\n\nWe will have a float in the march that reflects both the Columbus Pride theme \"United in Power\" and the No Kings Nationwide Day of Defiance. March with us!\n\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.*\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no kings.**\n\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

As Missouri legislators return home after undermining voter-approved amendments, we will gather to demand that our voices be heard and respected.\nFor over a century, Missourians have relied on the citizen initiative process to shape our state's laws. That process is now under attack. In April, Governor Kehoe signed SB22, also known as the \"Let Politicians Lie Act.” This bill guts the initiative process, making it nearly impossible for everyday citizens to put measures on the ballot without political interference.\nWe are rallying to protect our democracy and support a proposed 2026 amendment that would: 1-Ban politicians from overturning voter-approved amendments 2-Protect the initiative process from added barriers 3-Stop misleading ballot language that manipulates voters\nTogether, we will send a clear message: We, the people, have the final say.\n\nEvent Highlights\n ✨ Guest Speakers\n✨ Petitions, voter registration, calls & letters\n✨ “Hands Around the Square”– Circle of Unity\n✨ Family-friendly and peaceful\n\nBring: Signs, voice, water, snacks, chair/blanket, and comfortable shoes.\n\nMeet: In Park Central Square \nParking: Nearby free parking garages and lots available.",

The Assembly must stop siding with fossil fuel interests and get it done this year!**\n\nThe NY HEAT Act is our top climate priority, with its promise of lower energy bills while eliminating massive subsidies to the fracked gas industry. \n\nAs New Yorkers face the threats of climate change and rising costs of living, the NY HEAT Act will make energy more affordable while moving off fossil fuels.\n\n_Rally co-sponsors: All Our Energy, Food & Water Watch (list in formation)_",

    "description": "_Demand Accountability. Defend Democracy._\n\n**IMPEACH. CONVICT. REMOVE.**\n\nThe time has come to hold power accountable. That thing and his regime have shown a complete disregard for the very principles that our nation was built upon. From undermining democratic institutions to manipulating power for personal gain, their actions have eroded the core values of our Republic. We cannot, and will not, allow these abuses to go unchallenged.\n\n**Impeach:** We demand that those who hold positions of power—especially the highest office in the land—are held accountable for their actions. We call for the impeachment of DonOld (t)Rump for his violations of the Constitution, his attacks on democratic norms, and his relentless attempts to obstruct justice.\n\n\n**Convict:** An impeachment without conviction is only a partial victory. To restore the integrity of our democracy, we must ensure that justice is served. (t)Rump’s actions have shown a flagrant disregard for the rule of law, and he must be convicted for his abuse of power.\n\n\n**Remove:** The ultimate goal is the removal of DonOld (t)Rump from office. A 'leader' who has shown such blatant corruption, disregard for human rights, and contempt for our democracy does not deserve to lead this nation any longer. It’s time to remove him from power and restore the people's faith in our government.\n\nThis protest is not just about one person, but about the very future of our democracy. Every abuse of power, every instance of corruption, and every attempt to silence dissent is a step toward the erosion of our freedoms. By standing together, we send a clear message that we will not allow those in power to act above the law.\n\n**Why We Must Act _Now_:**\n\n- The longer we allow corruption and power abuse to go unchecked, the more entrenched it becomes.\n- Democracy is fragile, and it is our duty to protect it. History will judge us by what we do in these crucial moments.\n- If we fail to demand accountability now, we risk paving the way for future leaders to follow in Trump's footsteps and further undermine the principles of justice and democracy.\n\nThe fight for justice is not easy, but it is **necessary.** This is our moment to act—for the future of our nation, for our children, and for the preservation of democracy itself.",

    "description": "On June 14, from 11:00am- 1:30pm we will gather at the intersection of US-1 & SR-520, Cocoa, FL to remind Trump and his enablers: America has No King!\n🔘Please bring your own beverages & signs.\n🔘There will be some signs, sign making materials & water provided.\n🔘Feel free to dress in costumes.\n🔘Music & street theater throughout gathering.\n🔘This is a Peaceful gathering. Please ignore any distractors, use crosswalks, & stay on sidewalks. There will be safety people in vests on all 4 corners.\n‼️➡️Since many food pantries & shelters are taking financial hits, WE ARE DOING A FOOD & SUPPLIES DRIVE on the SW corner-\nIf you're able, please bring non-perishable food, blankets, socks, etc. to donate.⬅️‼️\nDonald Trump thinks his rule is absolute, but in America, we don’t do “kings.” Since the inauguration, the Trump administration and its enablers have operated as though they have a mandate—but they don’t, and never did. They are going to extremes to empower Trump and enrich themselves, while cutting jobs and services for the rest of us. Now, they’re turning Flag Day into a celebration of Trump.\n💰 He’s using OUR tax dollars to pay for HIS party: Donald Trump’s birthday celebration is expected to cost millions of our tax dollars, all while Republicans claim there’s no money for Social Security, SNAP, or Medicaid.\n👑 We are united against kings: Trump has already indicated that he’s aiming for at least a third term, and now he’s planning a self-aggrandizing military parade in D.C But the American people don’t put up with kings. Together, we will mobilize in huge numbers to reject this corruption and abuse of power—it’s in our DNA as a country.\n✋ They’ve gone too far: This is bigger than political disagreement. They’ve defied our courts, deported American citizens, disappeared people off the streets, and slashed our services—all while orchestrating a massive giveaway to their billionaire allies. Enough is enough. For anyone who thinks he’s gone too far, this movement is for you.\nWe’re standing together against the abuses of power, cruelty, and corruption.\nWhen clowns 🤡 are elected, expect a circus 🎪 -\nAmerica 🇺🇸 has No King! 👑",
