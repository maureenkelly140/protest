    "description": "Join Champlain Valley Indivisible for a family-friendly rally in support of our libraries and museums on Friday, May 9 in Shelburne. 3:00pm - 5:30pm. Meet in front of the Shelburne town office building and we’ll spread out from there along Shelburne Road. Stop by for a few minutes or join us for a few hours!\n\nIn March, President Trump issued an Executive order directing the dismantling of the the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), as well as six other agencies. The announcement also orders the Office of Management and Budget to reject any budget requests from IMLS (and the other six named agencies) other than funds needed to shut down the agency. This week, Trump released his 2026 budget proposal, which calls for the wholesale elimination of the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, as well as several other federal and regional cultural agencies.\n\nWe believe Culture Counts, that it's important to preserve art and history and literature, among other things, and we want to support our local libraries and museums as much as possible. Saturday, May 10 is opening day for Shelburne Museum, so we are gathering in support of the museum and library on Friday, May 9. Please join your friends and neighbors for this peaceful rally - let’s show our library and museum how essential they are to our community! \n\n***Please do not park at the Pierson Library. Look for other parking in town.",

Kelly is an artist who has spent decades creating massive community sculptures out of balloons, so we thought we would will the entire first floor of our house right balloons and invite our community of friends to good food and drinks. The event is FREE! But donations to Kelly Cheatle's campaign are encouraged at the party! Also my (soon-to-be) famous G.O.A.T-meal cookies* will be available to sample and purchase for $5 at the event and all proceeds will go to Kelly's campaign! \n \nLet your kids and political imagination run wild in a room full of balloons. And in addition enjoy some top-notch pizza, lemonade, chocolate chip cookies, and artisan beers with candidate Kelly and friends!\n\nHosted by Rajesh & Erica Barnabas along with Jeanne Strazzabosco\n\n*G.O.A.T.-meal cookies stand for \"Greatest of All Time\" (oatmeal cookies).",

Now the cuts are here — and the stakes couldn’t be higher.\n\nBy early May, Congress will have voted on devastating federal budget cuts that could strip away healthcare, food assistance, public education funding, and child care from millions of working families across California. If implemented, these cuts would impact more than 15 million Californians — while giving billionaires tax breaks in one of the largest wealth transfers in U.S. history.\n\nWe refuse to be silent.\n\nJoin us on Wednesday, May 13th from 6:30PM-8:00pm for a We Are California Federal Budget Teach-In. We’ll share urgent updates on these sweeping cuts and coordinate how we fight back — together.

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",

    "description": "From coast to coast, protests are clearly working!  A recent poll shows that 56% of independents (our target market!) believe “Trump is a dangerous dictator whose power should be limited.”  We’re glad they agree with us!\n\nYet Republicans continue to bend the knee to Trump, with efforts to pass his “big beautiful budget.” \n\nWe believe his budget is toxic and will create devastating consequences for all of us, especially children, the elderly and veterans.  So why do Republicans want it?  To give more tax cuts to the rich!\n\nWe are fighting back with another protest!\n\nTHEME:  TRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET \n\nWHEN: Friday, May 23rd, 3 to 4 pm\n\nWHERE: 32051 Camino Capistrano, SJC (Intersection of Camino Capistrano and Del Obispo.  Please meet near Ross Dress for Less.)\n\nResearch proves that protests are only effective when they have a focused message. Please focus all signs on TRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET.  For example:\n\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET KICKS GRANDMA OUT OF HER NURSING HOME!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET CUTS CANCER RESEARCH!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET BETRAYS THE ELDERLY!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET CUTS FOOD BANK $$$!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET CUTS EDUCATION!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET BENEFITS BILLIONAIRES—NOT YOU!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET BETRAYS VETS!\n\nWe’re not trying to limit free speech, we’re strategizing for maximum impact, so please stay on message.\n\nWe had over 2,000 people at our last protest. We can have 4,000 at this one if you bring just one friend!\n\nAs Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said, “These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace…Are you ready for the fight?”\n\nWe are!\n\nAnn & Darcie, Co-chairs\nDWSOC Rapid Response Team",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego.

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, deported children who are American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n**On Saturday, June 14, we’re joining hundreds of protests nationwide to build a movement that leaves Trump behind.**\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "We proudly invite you to join our May General Membership Meeting and Social on Wednesday, May 14th, held at 1920 Ybor, Social from 6:00 pm to 6:30 pm meeting will be from 6:30 pm - 8 pm!\n\nThis month, we are proud to welcome Curtis Lopez-Galloway & Samuel Nieves from the Conversion Therapy Survivor Network! \n\nThe Conversion Therapy Survivor Network is a U.S.-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded and led by survivors of conversion therapy. Its mission is to unite individuals who have endured sexual and/or gender identity change and suppression efforts, providing a supportive community that addresses the lasting impact of these practices. The organization offers a safe space for survivors to share their experiences and connect with others who have faced similar trauma, fostering healing through shared understanding and connection.\n\nhttps://www.conversionsurvivor.org\n\nCurtis Lopez-Galloway (Founder & President) - Palm Springs, CA - grew up in a small town in Southern Illinois. When he was 16 years old he was subjected to conversion therapy; an experience he was later able to use to ban conversion therapy in his home State. Curtis went on to be a leading figure in many LGBTQ+ organizations in the Midwest. Now living in California, Curtis has taken his activism to the next level and founded the Conversion Therapy Survivor Network to bring survivors of conversion therapy together in community and solidarity. In his free time, Curtis likes to try new food, hike nature trails, explore new places, and enjoy nights on the couch.\n\nSamuel Nieves (Board Director) - Tacoma, WA - a dynamic advocate and dedicated supporter of Survivors, is known for his vocal opposition to conversion therapy. He actively engages with social media, sharing insights, holding practitioners accountable, and openly discussing his own experiences with conversion therapy. Hailing from a Mexican American background and raised in Provo, Utah, Samuel pursued a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, which he successfully obtained in 2019. Subsequently, he embarked on a journey in marriage and family therapy. While he ultimately left the therapy field, Samuel continues to play a pivotal role by facilitating weekly community meetings and providing much-needed support.\n\nPARKING UPDATE: There is Ybor Parking Lot #3 directly behind the 1920 Ybor, across the street at the intersection of 6th Ave. and 20th St. The first two hours of parking are free!",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Edge of Appalachia Ohio Indivisible is partnering with Women’s March for this Nationwide creative action protest! 👏🏼🎪🎡🎠🤡\n\n“When you elect clowns, they don’t become leaders. The country becomes a circus.\n\nOn June 14, Donald Trump will honor himself with a four-mile military parade in our nation’s capitol. Trump’s tacky parade was inspired by dictators he idolizes, and will cost taxpayers nearly $100 million. \n\nOrganizer and strategist Daniel Hunter has written that “Humor is important for our psyches — and to take fascists down a notch[…] Humor is key for morale and exposing the vulnerability of the strongman image.” This is where the ridiculous meets the resistance—and where the future is on the line.\n\nJune 14 is our chance to reflect the absurdity of the MAGA regime and the clowns who lead it. To meet this moment, Women’s March will host community circuses nationwide—bold, creative actions that mirror the chaos MAGA has sown across the country. Together, we’ll set a national record for the most circuses held in a single day while we simultaneously refuse to celebrate a petty clown who desperately wants to be seen as strong. We won’t stop until we build the country we all deserve.\n`\nOur grassroots street circuses turn satire into resistance and reclaim the big tent for democracy.”\n\nWho’s ready to participate in a circus theme protest?!🤡🎪🎡🤹🏼‍♀️🎠\n\nWe need creatives, musicians visual art presenters, A JUGGLER, etc. If you have any circus decorations already we could borrow or find any thrifting we’d love to borrow! We’ll also be looking for a popcorn machine.\n\nWe’ll be reaching out to the city of Hillsboro to see what it takes to shut down a whole road or intersection.👏🏼\n\n#KickOutTheClowns\n#GreatestShitshowOnEarth\n#CommunitiesNotClowns\n#ClownsAgainstClowns \n#BigTentResistance",

We are also coming up with a donation drive to help support our communities.\n\n***More details on the agenda for the day coming soon.\n\nRemember what we are focused on. Do not let agitators or aggressors get a negative rise out of us, they are only distracting us from our goal, our movement. If we are approached by such folks we will step back and chant protect the constitution and this is what community looks like.\n\nThere are 2 free public parking lots near the meeting location, 3 and 5 minute walks as well as 2 hour parking directly in front of where we will be.

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

    "description": "In 2025, Virginia is a political battleground—and the stakes couldn't be higher. MAGA and Project 2025 are working to roll back voting rights, suppress opposition, and dismantle fundamental protections like due process. But their efforts won’t stop at Virginia’s borders.\n\nWhat happens in one swing state can ripple across the country. \n\nSacramento voters should pay attention—because when MAGA and Project 2025 tactics take hold in one place, they often spread, shaping national laws, court decisions, and public opinion everywhere.\nJoin us for a critical conversation with Delegate Michael Feggans, a 20-year Air Force veteran and state legislator, about how he’s standing up for democracy in Virginia—and why his fight is our fight, too. \n\nDelegate Feggans will discuss his legislative priorities, including:\n**Reproductive Rights:** Advocating for the protection of reproductive freedoms.\n**Public Education:** Supporting increased funding and resources for public schools.\n**Veteran Affairs:** Assisting veterans in transitioning to high-tech career fields.\n**Gun Safety:** Promoting common-sense gun safety measures.\n\nWith a background in both military service and technology entrepreneurship, Delegate Feggans brings a unique perspective to the General Assembly. He is committed to serving the community that raised him and addressing the complex challenges ahead with compassionate leadership.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you on Monday May 12!",

    "description": "Wow! What a great location for a standout! A few of us tried it out on Friday, May 2. There's a full-size sidewalk on the west side, and a narrow sidewalk (kind of like the narrow sidewalk at Mountain Park Rd.) on the east side. The west side will accommodate more people than the east side.\n\nThere's lots and lots of traffic passing by. Southampton Road (Routes 10/202) is heavily traveled northbound and southbound, and the Mass Pike eastbound and westbound is below. Lots of honks and thumbs up and waves...and a few folks flying middle fingers. We smile and wave at them all! \n\nWe'll have letterboards prepared for the lower part of the overpass fencing - the photo shows how that will look to folks passing on the Mass Pike. We're interacting with motorists on the Mass Pike, and on Southampton Road. We've discovered that the magic happens when we smile and wave to people!\n\nCome when you can, and leave when you must. You needn't be present for the entire 2-hour standout.\n\n### How to Get There\n\nThe address \"130 Southampton Road, Westfield\" will get you just north of the overpass. \n\n### Parking\n\nWe can't park in the Southampton Rd breakdown lane. There's a vacant business property three or four properties north of the bridge, and it seems that parking would be OK there.\n\nIt looks like The Wealth Technology Group has vacated their office at 130 Southampton Rd, but the internet says that other businesses are located there, so please be mindful if you decide to park there.\n\n### Etiquette!\n\nWe don't give the finger to people who give the finger to us, or who say unpleasant things. We smile and wave to them, too. \n\nWe may see a counter protester. If so, the best thing to do is just ignore them and spend our time and energy waving to motorists. Let's keep things 100% non-confrontational in words and body language.\n\n### Other Stuff\n\nPlease take everything you brought away with you, and leave the site totally clean.\n\nIf rain is predicted, we'll cancel. If we cancel, you'll receive an email notification.\n\n### A Few Requests\n\nWe've found that roof rake sections make wonderful flagpoles and banner poles. If you have a roof rake (or 10’-15’ light metal poles or conduit) to contribute, we'll be happy to take it off your hands!\n\nDonations...we've purchased banners and grommets and flags and zip ties and bungee cords, and we'll be getting more. We’ve purchased 20” x 30” letter boards for messaging we can change. All this costs $$$. We'll have a bucket for donations, and if you could throw something in, that'd be great. And if not, that's perfectly OK, too - your presence is what's really important. See where the money's going! https://tinyurl.com/IN-SLWMProtestTeamFinancials\n\n\nphoto: Rob Robertson",

Bring your own signs and flags, but we'll also have signs to share. **Rain or shine, but be weather aware.**\n\nMay's theme: **Where's Womack?** **Where's Cotton?** What are they doing to **Protect Medicare and Medicaid**? **Tax the Rich Instead!**\n\nA core principle behind all Indivisible NWA events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all hosts and participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.\n\n(If you want to try to go in, be prepared for it to be not-easy. The building management would like to limit visitors to three at a time and for all others to stay outside. So why not stay outside and let other Arkansans know what's going on?) Cotton and Womack both have offices in this building.",

Mobilize requires you to put in a location.\n\nThis is a letter or postcard writing campaign that you can do on your own time.\n\nHere is what  the Fix Our Forests Act would do:\n\nThe Fix Our Forests Act presents a contentious approach to forest management, balancing wildfire mitigation efforts with environmental and public participation concerns. \n\nHR 471 passed the House.  The Senate has yet to vote.\n\nThis legislation does little to invest in research-based wildlife protections.   \n\nInstead, it focuses on opening federal lands to logging interests.  It also bypasses critical environmental laws, including the Endangered Species Act, that protect our ecosystems. It also restricts scientific input and public engagement.  The bill could have devastating consequences for the environment and endangered species.\n\nHere is a simple letter you can copy and paste to email or write to your SENATORS:\n\nDear Senator,\n\nI am writing to urge Senator _______ to oppose HR 471, the Fix Our Forests Act, which recently passed the House.  I oppose this bill because:\n\n- It ignores proven wildfire community protection measures and prioritizes opening federal lands to logging interests.\n-It will open millions of acres of federal land to logging without scientific review or community input.\n- It encourages the removal of large old trees that mitigate climate change by storing high amounts of carbon.\n-It could lead to increased road density and increased risk of human-caused fires.\n- It guts key pieces of the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nYour Constituent,\n\nYour name.",

    "description": "Zoom Informational meetings about June 16-28 march from Philly to DC\n\nDemocracy 12 aims to inspire concerned citizens of all stripes to rise up in peaceful, happy, and creative protest.\n\nWe are doing this by taking a walk–a rather long walk–from Philadelphia to DC.\n\nThat’s the big picture.\n\nHere are our two big goals:\n\nONE:\n\nWe hope to find a core group of 12 walkers. \n\nThis mission needs a human-powered spirit team, and this group has to be everything we want our democracy to be: peaceful, civil, inspired and inspiring.  Committed and reliable.  Ready to set aside ordinary things. \n\nIf you’re possibly interested in becoming part of the core team, reach out, check us out. We get that becoming a core walker is a dive-in decision, so it's probably best if you get a feel for who we are and what we are doing to make the core group a team that’s happily, totally into it. Accommodations and meals will be on a sliding-scale for this group, as we desire to have a diverse group joining us.  If you cannot make the whole walk due to other obligations please don't let that stop you from inquiring.\n\n​\n\nTWO:\n\nWe hope that our walk will inspire and support local creativity, community, and peaceful resistance, all along the way.  \n\nThis is how our march becomes your march, and actually, it’s sort of  like everyone’s march.   \n\nSo many concerned citizens are already creating and connecting in peaceful, resolute resistance, and it's already making a difference...\n\nLet's keep on keeping on.\n\nCheck out our website www.democracy12.com. We hope to see you soon!",

Follow the blue accessibility signs to the ramp and to the accessible entrance.

    "description": "Join tens of thousands of your fellow Chicago-area citizens as we form a human chain of conscience across Chicagoland in peaceful protest against Trump’s illegal and authoritarian actions and the GOP's failure to defend the Constitution.\n\nWe will line sidewalks along 30 miles from Aurora to Chicago along Ogden Ave, 26th Street and California Ave to Douglass Park. This is a peaceful protest. We will not block streets or businesses along the route.\n\nBring signs, wear black, and make some noise.\n\nFind and reserve your spot here: www.handsacrosschi.com\n\nUsing the website widget will help us spread people out evenly along the route, while keeping people close to where they live.\n\nPresident Trump has defied court orders and forcibly sent people to a torture dungeon in El Salvador without a hearing or due process. Now he claims he’s unable to bring them back. He's ignored court rulings and arrested judges. If he can do this to them, he can do it to anyone.\n\nThese are the actions of a dictator—not a democratically elected president. Silence is not an option. When leaders cross the line into authoritarianism, it’s up to us—the people—to push back. This protest is about more than politics. It's about defending basic human dignity, civil liberties, and the idea that no one is above the law.",

Committed and reliable.  Ready to set aside ordinary things. \n\nIf you’re possibly interested in becoming part of the core team, reach out, check us out. We get that becoming a core walker is a dive-in decision, so it's probably best if you get a feel for who we are and what we are doing to make the core group a team that’s happily, totally into it. Accommodations and meals will be on a sliding-scale for this group, as we desire to have a diverse group joining us.  If you cannot make the whole walk due to other obligations please don't let that stop you from inquiring.\n\nWe will post and email route/hotel information as soon as it is available on our website for both \"core walkers\" and anyone that wants to participate. \n​\n\nTWO:\nWe hope that our walk will inspire and support local creativity, community, and peaceful resistance, all along the way.  \n\nThis is how our march becomes your march, and actually, it’s sort of  like everyone’s march.   \n\nSo many concerned citizens are already creating and connecting in peaceful, resolute resistance, and it's already making a difference...\n\nLet's keep on keeping on.\n\nCheck out our website www.democracy12.com. We hope to see you soon!",

Join me and learn how to take action, find a group, start one of your own, or even run for local office. Learn about building grassroots power for all the fights to come. Together, we can defeat the anti-democratic movement within the Republican party, dismantle the GOP's advantage in key swing states, and maintain and expand Democratic power at the federal level. \n\nIf you haven’t heard of it, Swing Left is a national network that helps people find high impact ways to support Democratic candidates.

    "description": "Join Capital Region Indivisible groups and other area activists to protest Elise Stefanik and the GOP at their Spring Picnic in Elm Avenue Park, Bethlehem. \n\nARRIVAL TIME: Plan to be parked and in place by 1:30 when GOP will start arriving. Their event starts at 2:00 and people will arrive before that. Also press often come early and then leave, so we want good numbers early.\n\nPARKING: As you enter the park, the best place to park are the lots on your right behind the tennis courts. If those fill up head to the left and park in the large lots next to the pool complex. Do NOT park by the playground further down. \n\nWHERE WE WILL BE LOCATED: We will be protesting along the road on Rt. 32 and immediately inside the park along the road leading to the parking lots. We are not protesting at the event pavilion as we want to keep this peaceful, AND optics for newspaper pictures will be a lot better with us all at the front of the park.\n\nMESSAGING AND SIGNS: Let's be sure everyone knows the harms the GOP and Stefanik are inflicting on everyday people by their votes to cut benefits and programs (Medicaid, food stamps, rental assistance, benefits for children with disabilities, etc) all so they can give tax breaks for their wealthy donors, corporations and billionaire friends, that Stefanik votes in lock step with the Republican led Congress, and that she is not welcome here!\n\nHANDS OFF ________________ GOP!\nHANDS OFF OUR HEALTHCARE ELISE!\nGO HOME ELISE!\nELISE & GOP VOTE FOR TAX CUTS FOR BILLIONAIRES!\nNO CUTS TO OUR BENEFITS FOR BILLIONAIRE GIVE AWAYS!\nSHAME ON THE GOP!\nELISE, YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE!\n\nSAFETY AND RESTROOMS: We will have trained Safety marshalls circulating and helping to direct you to parking and restrooms. Restrooms are in the warming hut if you are familiar with the park.\n\nEveryone must be committed to non-violence and non-engagement even if provoked. We want a peaceful and powerful demonstration.",

This location also happens to be in Tom Kean Jr's congressional district (NJ-7) so let's make sure we keep demanding he stops hiding and hosts a public town hall.\n\nParking is generally available at the Staples across the street, which also has supplies for signs.

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

Last time we covered all 4 corners, this time let's do the same AND line the streets in each direction!\n\nSaturday, May 17th is both Armed Forces Day and graduation weekend for many.  We will come together in peaceful action to 'defend our defenders' and 'stand up for our students'.  \n\nBring your sign, bring your voice, and bring your friends! This event is family friendly and accessible. \n\nThere is plenty of parking in lots around the intersection.  \nThis is a rain or shine event, so dress accordingly!\nIf it's a sunny day, hats and sunscreen are always recommended, as is a water bottle!\n\nThis event is co-hosted by Rise Up Western Mass Indivisible, Defending Democracy in Hampden County, and Indivisible Northampton/Swing Left Western Mass",

This is a peaceful protest. We will not block streets or businesses along the route.\n\nRegister on Mobilize, then please go to https://www.handsacrosschi.com/ and enter your zip code to get an assigned location along the route. This is important so that we can spread people out evenly along the route, while keeping people closer to where they live. IGNORE THE MAP BELOW; THIS IS NOT YOUR ASSIGNED LOCATION.\n\nPresident Trump has defied court orders and forcibly sent people to a torture dungeon in El Salvador without a hearing or due process. Now he claims he’s unable to bring them back. He's ignored court rulings and arrested judges. If he can do this to them, he can do it to anyone.\n\nThese are the actions of a dictator—not a democratically elected president. Silence is not an option. When leaders cross the line into authoritarianism, it’s up to us—the people—to push back. This protest is about more than politics. It's about defending basic human dignity, civil liberties, and the idea that no one is above the law.\n\nBring your family, friends, neighbors, coworkers—anyone who believes in freedom and democracy.",

This is a highly visible spot, with thousands of cars per hour. Our weekly presence gives hope and inspiration to passersby who have not yet resolved to take action.

This peaceful demonstration falls under our First Amendment rights to public assembly and freedom of speech.\n\n☆ Meet at the intersection of Hannaford Drive and Shelburne Rd. \n\n☆ Parking: Head west on Hannaford Drive. Turn left onto Fayette Road (just before Lowe's). There's plenty of parking on both sides of the road. ***DO NOT PARK ON THE ROAD BORDERING TESLA - it is private property!\n\n☆ Use the lights/crosswalks to cross Shelburne Rd and Hannaford Dr\n☆ Please be respectful of all who interact with us.

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\nSaturday, June 14th is Flag Day and a good time to remind Trump and the MAGA crowd this is OUR flag and we are taking it back from this authoritarian administration. \n\nJune 14 also happens to be the birthday of the narcissistic wannabe King. Trump plans to hold a military parade in DC, so we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings!\n\nWe’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nJoin us at Springfield at City Hall from 12:00-2:00PM.  \nTogether we will rally to declare NO Kings AND to take back our flag!\nThis event is co-hosted by Rise Up Western Mass Indivisible, Indivisible Northampton/Swing Left Western Mass, and Defending Democracy in Hampden County.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

    "description": "🔥Pasco Resists🔥 will hold a protest Thursday May 8th to support our Veterans. To protest the massive cuts coming to the VA. To stand proudly with them as we honor their service. And their sacrifice. \n\nAnd to protest the Orange king’s decision to celebrate a holiday which Moscow celebrates— VE Day (Victory in Europe) the end of WWII in Europe, not in the US (which is August 15- VJ Day-Victory over Japan), with the OK calling it Victory Day, honoring WWII veterans only. And re-naming Veterans Day Nov 11, as Victory Day, but only to honor WWI veterans, since it was the end of WWI. What about other veterans? Korean, Viet Nam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria…and all of this idiocy in face of the cuts to the Department of Veteran Affairs of > 80k jobs is disrespectful and heinous to ALL of our Veterans.  And let’s get LOUD so Congressman Gus Bilirakis can hear us! We have a chair for you. Currently a poster of you is sitting there. And The Chicken. \n\n\n🤪\"I am hereby renaming May 8th as Victory Day for World War II and November 11th as Victory Day for World War I\"🤪\n\nThe move to rename Veterans Day would overwrite 87 years of precedent in recognizing Nov. 11 as a national holiday celebrating all U.S. Military Veterans from all branches in all conflicts, in war or peace time. \n🛑Stop this madness!!🛑\n\n🇺🇸Veteran's Day🇺🇸 is for veterans of ALL combat conflicts. And not be changed at the whim of a draft dodger and convicted felon.\n\nTrump’s disregard for the reverence shown Veterans by having a holiday honoring their service and ultimate sacrifice, is lost in his thoughtless name change. His lack of respect and acknowledgment of the selfless commitment of Veterans is evident in the callous cancellation of much needed support programs. Changing the name of the holiday which honors all of their efforts without considering the historical context is shameful.\n   \nAxing 80,000 people from Veteran Affairs, doctors, nurses, college program, he builds on his disrespect for veterans.\n\nPresident Trump’s proposal to rename Veterans Day, November 11, to “Victory Day for World War I” and create a new holiday May 8th for World War II threatens to erase the inclusive recognition of all U.S. veterans.\nVeterans Day, established to honor veterans from all wars, is a solemn day of reflection and respect for those who have served. Renaming it would ignore the sacrifices of those from later conflicts.\nThis change is divisive and risks undermining the legacy of those who fought in every war. Stand with veterans and preserve this important tradition.\n\nHe has the significance, the days mixed up. VE Day was May 8 - Victory in Europe. Not celebrated by Americans since we were still at war with Japan. VJ Day is August 15- Victory over Japan. November 11 is Veterans Day- celebrating veterans of all wars, a precedent for 87 years. It’s also when WWI ended. But now Trump wants to celebrate Veterans Day as Victory Day for WWI veterans only. And make May 8 Victory Day for WWII veterans. Same as what Putin celebrates. \n\nTrump, who has spoken about avoiding the Vietnam War draft, has a long track record of making disparaging remarks about veterans and military service. In 2015, he was widely criticized for an attack on Republican Sen. John McCain, who survived five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Trump said McCain was not a war hero because he was captured by the North Vietnamese. In 2020, the Atlantic magazine, citing four unnamed people with firsthand knowledge of Trump’s comments, reported that Trump called U.S. troops injured or killed in war “losers,” which Trump denied.\n\nHe is a disgrace to our Veterans. He has no compassion for the sacrifices our Veterans have made to serve our country.\n\nPress Release:\nhttps://1drv.ms/w/c/2cf383e393bdc82f/EV966l1oOIlJj_8dzdtDt_4BezEK-fM9Nb65m-BGCjQUuw",
