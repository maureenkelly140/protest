    "description": "Come join us to knock doors and talk to voters about the upcoming primary election!\n\nAbout Daniel: As the first in his family to go to college, Daniel attended the University of Arizona where he interned for then-Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Daniel was a survivor of the 2011 Tucson shooting and was the first to administer first aid before EMTs arrived on the scene. Turning tragedy into resilience, Daniel decided to live a life of public service to protect Arizonan families and served on the Sunnyside School board (2011-2015) and was later elected to the Arizona State Legislature (2017-2022). Now, Daniel is running for Congress to Fight the Trump Administration to protect Arizonans' social security and healthcare access, expand federal dollars into public education, and lower the cost of everyday goods and housing.",

    "description": "We've heard the talk from Trump and Elon, that our government is TOO BIG, SO FULL OF FRAUD AND WASTE, and the only cure for this is to take a gilded chainsaw to it and cut it down to size in order to lower taxes. Enter DOGE and the tech bros combing through our personal data firing government employees. \n\nDoes this actually work for us? Will it benefit working class people by making these services more reliable and economical? Spoiler alert: IT WILL NOT!\n\nJoin us for our 5-part community discussion series titled \"Privatization is THEFT!\" where we explore what government's responsibility is to it's people, how they've traditionally done that, and what happens when public services go into private corporate hands to be run as efficiently as possible, like a business. \n\nWe will culminate our series with attendance at the June 14th NO KINGS rally being held in Albany, for those that can make it. \n\nSession 1: Wednesday May 14th - Intro to The Privatization of Public Goods.\nSession 2: Wednesday May 21st - The Privatization of Healthcare.\nSession 3: Wednesday May 28th - The Privatization of Education and Childcare.\nSession 4: Wednesday June 11th - What's Next - Who owns the Water?\nSession 5: Saturday June 14th - Putting it into Practice at the NO KINGS Rally.",

Daniel was a survivor of the 2011 Tucson shooting and was the first to administer first aid before EMTs arrived on the scene. Turning tragedy into resilience, Daniel decided to live a life of public service to protect Arizonan families and served on the Sunnyside School board (2011-2015) and was later elected to the Arizona State Legislature (2017-2022). Now, Daniel is running for Congress to Fight the Trump Administration to protect Arizonans' social security and healthcare access, expand federal dollars into public education, and lower the cost of everyday goods and housing.",

Its primary purpose is to prevent foreign influence and corruption of U.S. officials.\n\nThe ultimate Trump grift = accepting a $400 million Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, a Flying Palace, from the Qatari royal family.\nWe know Trump can't be bothered to read the Constitution or understand the oath he took to the Office of the Presidency, and if MAGA Republican lawmakers allow this grift, it tells us what they think of the Constitution.\n\nJoin us at noon on May 23rd at the Williamsburg James City County Courthouse, located at 5201 Monticello Avenue, Williamsburg, with your signs, and a chair if necessary, to let our community know what you think about this and all the other times Trump has ignored the Constitution and American Norms.\n\nIt will be hot so please, do not forget a cold beverage and dress appropriately for the weather - maybe a hat or umbrella.\n\nAs with our previous events, the same rules apply. We will not engage with counter-protesters. If an issue arises, please notify one of the event organizers, who will be wearing Williamsburg JCC Indivisible t-shirts. We will not engage in any acts of violence or violation of any applicable laws or engage in civil disobedience. All actions will be peaceful. Everyone participating in this event will be required to behave lawfully to ensure the safety of event participants and will seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. We will obey the orders of authorized event marshals and law enforcement authorities. Event organizers will not be responsible for any injury or damage if any were to occur during this event. We will park in the Courthouse parking lot without blocking access lanes and will remove any trash that is left. We are committed to maintaining public health measures to practice safe protesting during these times. Please wear a mask and socially distance if that makes you more comfortable - weigh your own risk in attending. Follow all local safety guidelines at minimum, and any safety instructions from hosts that exceed local law.",

    "description": "Trump wants a military parade. We’re giving him a history lesson.\n\nOn June 14, while Trump spends millions of taxpayer dollars celebrating his own birthday with tanks and pageantry, Indivisible Woodstock CAN will join communities across the country for No Kings—a national day of action against authoritarianism and billionaire corruption.\n\nFlag Day isn’t about glorifying a man. It marks the birth of the U.S. Army—the day our nation first stood up to a king. Now Trump wants to twist that legacy into a monument to himself. We’re here to say: No Thrones. No Crowns. No Kings.\n\n✊ WHY WE’RE MOBILIZING\nThis isn’t just political disagreement. It’s a coordinated power grab.\n\nHe’s using our tax dollars to throw his party—while they slash Social Security and gut Medicaid.\n\nHe’s defied courts, disappeared people, and threatened dissenters.\n\nHe’s pushing for a third term and building a machine to rule, not govern.\n\nWe’re done being quiet. We’re done pretending this is normal.\nThis is our country, and we’re showing up to defend it.\n\n🎖️ WHO THIS IS FOR\nWhether you’re a veteran who took the oath…\nA parent worried about your child’s future…\nOr a neighbor who just knows this isn’t right…\n\nThis moment is for you.\nCome stand with us in visible, nonviolent resistance. Let’s show the country what real patriotism looks like.\n\n🔔 WHAT TO EXPECT\nPeaceful rally and sidewalk demonstration—we’ll stay on sidewalks and paved areas and will not block traffic or pedestrians.\n\nSpeakers including veterans and community members\n\nA first aid/shade tent nearby\n\nSigns, chants, flags, and a united front against corruption\n\n🧭 WHAT TO BRING & WEAR\nWear red, white, and blue\n\nIf you’ve served or are currently serving, feel free to wear military attire\n\nBring water, sunscreen, and a sign if you’ve got one\n\n🛡️ OUR COMMUNITY GUIDELINES\nStay peaceful and nonviolent\n\nDo not bring weapons (even legally permitted ones)\n\nDo not engage with agitators or counter-protesters\n\nFollow the lead of our trained volunteers and coordinators\n\nKeep public areas accessible and safe for all\n\nThis is a nationwide mobilization to reject strongman rule and stand up for the people. We’re not spectators. We’re the story.\n\n\nHOSTED BY:\nIndivisible Woodstock CAN\n📧 woodstockcan@proton.me\n📣 Instagram: @indivisiblewoodstockcan\n🌐 www.woodstockcan.com",

    "description": "Trump wants a military parade. We’re giving him a history lesson.\n\nOn June 14, while Trump spends millions of taxpayer dollars celebrating his own birthday with tanks and pageantry, Indivisible Woodstock CAN will join communities across the country for No Kings—a national day of action against authoritarianism and billionaire corruption.\n\nFlag Day isn’t about glorifying a man. It marks the birth of the U.S. Army—the day our nation first stood up to a king. Now Trump wants to twist that legacy into a monument to himself. We’re here to say: No Thrones. No Crowns. No Kings.\n\n✊ WHY WE’RE MOBILIZING\nThis isn’t just political disagreement. It’s a coordinated power grab.\n\nHe’s using our tax dollars to throw his party—while they slash Social Security and gut Medicaid.\n\nHe’s defied courts, disappeared people, and threatened dissenters.\n\nHe’s pushing for a third term and building a machine to rule, not govern.\n\nWe’re done being quiet. We’re done pretending this is normal.\nThis is our country, and we’re showing up to defend it.\n\n🎖️ WHO THIS IS FOR\nWhether you’re a veteran who took the oath…\nA parent worried about your child’s future…\nOr a neighbor who just knows this isn’t right…\n\nThis moment is for you.\nCome stand with us in visible, nonviolent resistance. Let’s show the country what real patriotism looks like.\n\n🔔 WHAT TO EXPECT\nPeaceful rally and sidewalk demonstration—we’ll stay on sidewalks and paved areas and will not block traffic or pedestrians.\n\nSpeakers including veterans and community members\n\nA first aid/shade tent nearby\n\nSigns, chants, flags, and a united front against corruption\n\n🧭 WHAT TO BRING & WEAR\nWear red, white, and blue\n\nIf you’ve served or are currently serving, feel free to wear military attire\n\nBring water, sunscreen, and a sign if you’ve got one\n\n🛡️ OUR COMMUNITY GUIDELINES\nStay peaceful and nonviolent\n\nDo not bring weapons (even legally permitted ones)\n\nDo not engage with agitators or counter-protesters\n\nFollow the lead of our trained volunteers and coordinators\n\nKeep public areas accessible and safe for all\n\nThis is a nationwide mobilization to reject strongman rule and stand up for the people. We’re not spectators. We’re the story.\n\nHOSTED BY:\nIndivisible Woodstock CAN\n📧 woodstockcan@proton.me\n📣 Instagram: @indivisiblewoodstockcan\n🌐 www.woodstockcan.com",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

The fossil fuel industry is actively working to weaken and delay critical clean air rules that would help move homes off the dirty fossil fuels that drive this pollution.  \n\nWith unprecedented federal attacks on climate science and the gutting of federal protections for clean air and water, we need our local representatives to fill the leadership void. \n\n📅 Join us to rally for clean air on Friday, June 6 at 8 a.m. to tell the South Coast Air Quality Management District: Pass strong rules, no more delays, no more weakening.\n\nAfter the rally, you can make a public comment at the 9 a.m. SCAQMD board meeting to tell the board why you want clean, healthy air and climate action now.",

The committee needs your help making this year's drive successful. Please ask people in your network to donate blood and consider volunteering to help the day of the event.\n\t\t\nThe committee has a limited number of time slots; if you wish to donate, sign up online.

    "description": "Calling All Activist New Yorkers! Thank you for voting during primaries and for voting “down ballot” – voting for the local offices that have the most immediate impact on our everyday lives. BUT, did you know that a dismal 49% of NY voters participated in the last presidential election?\n \nThe Action Group NYC and Eleanor Roosevelt Independent Democratic Club are hosting a postcard writing initiative to send heartfelt messages to voters who sit out primary and midterm elections.  We've got a very important primary coming up on June 24th and some folks don't even know this is happening! \n\nJoin us on Tuesday, May 20th, 6 - 8 pm, 12 Grammercy Park South, as we gather together in a cozy townhouse and write messages that aim to rebuild our fragmented community.  Slow and steady, we can make the difference!\n \nYour personal encouragement goes a long way towards reminding New Yorkers of the power of their voice to make a difference, that speaking up and voting is the utmost form of activism.",

Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.\n\nJoin us at the intersection of Olde Waterford Way and Route 17 Southbound (400–448 Olde Waterford Way, Leland, NC 28451) between the hours of 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM on Saturday June 14th. Please park in the public parking areas near Harris Teeter just behind the intersection.\n\nThis is considered a \"stationery march\" where you will stand on the grass just off Route 17 at Olde Waterford Way and the traffic will pass you by. Your job is to be visible. Make yourself be seen. Our aim is to be respectful, safe and considerate of motorists passing us by. There will be representatives from the 2 sponsoring organizations – Indivisible Defenders of Democracy and Indivisible Wilmington.\n\nCome prepared. Bring a backpack with food and water, sunscreen, sunglasses, a hat and an umbrella in case of rain or to block the sun. Bring a chair too to sit a spell when you get tired. And of course bring a sign to let motorists know how you feel.

    "description": "You are an amazing group! All heroes in our eyes! We have news about TWO events! Yes TWO! So read carefully! The site and time will be the same, the dates will be different. So on Saturday May 31st we will gather at 147th and the East side of LaGrange Road in Orland Park at 11am until 1pm. This is a peaceful protest. Please do not engage with any counter protesters.  Some do not like this approach but we have found it to be the most successful way of having our voices heard and enjoying the community we have developed. There will be monitors on site if a de-escalation is needed.  On Saturday the 14th of June we will gather at the above mentioned place and same time for NO KINGS DAY. We know there are bigger venues but feel that some of our  most vulnerable that cannot make those trips have the same opportunity as everyone. We get people from nearby and far away! We post on many platforms so we do draw a great mix of people! On some platforms we are South Suburban Relentless and also Protect Our Rights.  Our last protest had a head count of over 100 and I heard one of our group say there were 150 supporters of OUR RGHTS that attended! Ten, Fifty or Hundreds, we are all fighting the good fight and on the right side of history.  As always bring a chair if you need a break. Bring water and friends! See you there! When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty! Kathy and Sharon.",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

Together, we will show our support for this brave nation who fights for DEMOCRACY every moment.\n\nIt will be hot so please, do not forget a cold beverage and dress appropriately for the weather - maybe a hat or umbrella.\n\nAs with our previous events, the same rules apply. We will not engage with counter-protesters. If an issue arises, please notify one of the event organizers, who will be wearing Williamsburg JCC Indivisible t-shirts. We will not engage in any acts of violence or violation of any applicable laws or engage in civil disobedience. All actions will be peaceful. Everyone participating in this event will be required to behave lawfully to ensure the safety of event participants and will seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. We will obey the orders of authorized event marshals and law enforcement authorities. Event organizers will not be responsible for any injury or damage if any were to occur during this event.

    "description": "This a local Indivisible event!\nProtest to Support our LGBTQ+ Community\n\nDate: Sunday, June 22nd \nTime: 4:00PM-5:30PM\nLocation: Hyannis Airport Rotary (details about parking and where exactly to stand listed below.) \nPlease wear “pride spirit” to make a visual impact as a rainbow sea of love, acceptance, and appreciation for diversity and all the unique talents that makes our community so vibrant. \nAs always, please bring signs, flags, drums, other instruments, chants, art, etc., as joy is resistance, art is resistance, community is resistance. [Joyful community resistance to fascism]\n\nIn honor/celebration of pride month, we are protesting against Trump & his administration, specifically against the harm he has caused to the LGBTQ+ community. We are infuriated with his executive orders that ban gender affirming care for minors, that restrict trans rights, and that eliminate protections against discrimination for those in the LGBTQ+ community. We recognize the detrimental effect this has had on the well being of many individuals and the community as a whole. We stand in solidarity to say we will not put up with this.\nWe will not allow this administration’s attacks on the LGBTQ+ community to continue! #RESIST\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n******Corruption destroys, Community Builds: We will also be collecting nonperishable food items for the AIDS support group in Hyannis. ******\n\nWe are being cosponsored by a local pride group, and have invited local pride groups to set up informational tables if they are available. \n\nAs with every protest, we also want to highlight the extreme unconstitutional practices of this administration, as this is not just about policies. \nThis is NOT business as usual in DC, this is NOT normal. \n\nThis republican administration has attempted to seize control over state election processes through executive orders and efforts to undermine civil rights legislation, as well as threatening the checks and balances established by the Constitution, such as disregarding court orders and altering federal regulations without proper authority.​​ The administration is using its current power to help billionaires continue to profit while striping away the services that help the most needy. \n\nWe need to stand up for due process, free speech, upholding court rulings, and the separation of church and state. The Founding Fathers established the principles of due process, free speech, and the separation of church and state through the First Amendment and other parts of the Constitution. These concepts were designed to protect individual rights and limit government power. \nWe have NO KINGS in America, yet Trump is acting like one. \nWe, the people, must rise up, and show that the power of the people is greater than the people in power. \n\nProtest Homework (aka, protest action steps)\n5 Calls App or Website, National Action Steps:\nScroll down to the LGBTQ+ section, as of right now there are 2 calls to make (to all 3 of your members of congress!):\n1. *“condemn RFK Jr’s False Report on Transgender Youth Treatment” and \n2. *“Oppose Efforts to Dehumanize transgender and LGBTQ+ people” \nIf you have time for another round of calls, please scroll to “executive overreach” and click:\n3. *”fight the trump administration’s defiance of the constitution and courts”",

Talk to your community, have fun and learn more about One Colorado.  \n\nWe’re thrilled to share that One Colorado will be attending 12 Pride events across the state this summer with even more on the calendar for this coming fall. From the Eastern Plains, through the Front Range, and to the Western Slope, we’re traveling far and wide to connect with LGBTQIA+ Coloradans and their families!\n\nAt each stop, we’ll be sharing what we’ve been up to from health equity and safe schools to voter engagement and trans rights. We also want to hear from you! Your stories, your needs, and your voices help shape the work we do every day.\n\nBut let’s also remember that Pride began as a riot, a powerful act of resistance led by trans women of color, fighting back against police brutality and demanding dignity and justice. Pride is a celebration, of course, but it’s also a call to action!\n\nWe hope you’ll walk with us in the continued fight for LGBTQIA+ rights. Whether you’re showing up, speaking out, or volunteering with us, your presence matters. Come say hi, get involved, and let us know how we can best support you and our community.\n\nCome connect with us at your local Pride!",

We then get it distributed right away to a local hunger relief recipient.\n\nThe work will happen in the farm's field in a variety of weather.

Share how Senator Daines' support for the Trump/DOGE agenda is affecting you and your community.\n\n📢 Where: Public sidewalks at W. Oak St. & Twin Lakes Ave.\n\n🗣️ What to Expect: We’ll line up on the public sidewalks with signs and take turns entering the office in pairs to deliver our messages directly to Senator Daines’ staff.\n\n✍️ How to Prepare: Bring your comments and signs — or just come to stand in solidarity.\n\nWhether you’re ready to speak or simply want to show support, your presence matters. Let’s keep up the pressure!\n\n*Note - if you do not intend to go in the office to meet with the Senator's staff, please park on the public streets instead of in the building's parking lot.",

    "description": "**Join us Wednesday, May 21st, for our May volunteer meeting, where we'll recap Maryland's busy legislative session and share updates on our work to fight the Trump-Musk agenda.**\n\nThis past session, Maryland saw thousands of bills enter the General Assembly, some good and others bad. Come hear more about our fight to hold polluters accountable via the RENEW Act and how we rallied against the Next Generation Energy Act that fast-tracks the permitting process for new toxic gas plants in Maryland.\n\nDuring the meeting, we'll also discuss our federal work, including the reintroduction of the WATER Act and how we're responding to Trump's attacks on climate and the people via extreme budget cuts to vital programs. \n\n**Come organize with us and learn how we'll continue to fight like we live here!**",
