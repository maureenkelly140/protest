They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We will not engage with counter-protesters. If an issue arises, please notify one of the event organizers, who will be wearing Williamsburg JCC Indivisible t-shirts. We will not engage in any acts of violence or violation of any applicable laws or engage in civil disobedience. All actions will be peaceful. Everyone participating in this event will be required to behave lawfully to ensure the safety of event participants and will seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. We will obey the orders of authorized event marshals and law enforcement authorities. Event organizers will not be responsible for any injury or damage if any were to occur during this event. We will park in the Courthouse parking lot without blocking access lanes and will remove any trash that is left. We are committed to maintaining public health measures to practice safe protesting during these times. Please wear a mask and socially distance if that makes you more comfortable - weigh your own risk in attending. Follow all local safety guidelines at minimum, and any safety instructions from hosts that exceed local law.",

    "description": "This a local Indivisible event!\nProtest to Support our LGBTQ+ Community\n\nDate: Sunday, June 22nd \nTime: 4:00PM-5:30PM\nLocation: Hyannis Airport Rotary (details about parking and where exactly to stand listed below.) \nPlease wear “pride spirit” to make a visual impact as a rainbow sea of love, acceptance, and appreciation for diversity and all the unique talents that makes our community so vibrant. \nAs always, please bring signs, flags, drums, other instruments, chants, art, etc., as joy is resistance, art is resistance, community is resistance. [Joyful community resistance to fascism]\n\nIn honor/celebration of pride month, we are protesting against Trump & his administration, specifically against the harm he has caused to the LGBTQ+ community. We are infuriated with his executive orders that ban gender affirming care for minors, that restrict trans rights, and that eliminate protections against discrimination for those in the LGBTQ+ community. We recognize the detrimental effect this has had on the well being of many individuals and the community as a whole. We stand in solidarity to say we will not put up with this.\nWe will not allow this administration’s attacks on the LGBTQ+ community to continue! #RESIST\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n******Corruption destroys, Community Builds: We will also be collecting nonperishable food items for the AIDS support group in Hyannis. ******\n\nWe are being cosponsored by a local pride group, and have invited local pride groups to set up informational tables if they are available. \n\nAs with every protest, we also want to highlight the extreme unconstitutional practices of this administration, as this is not just about policies. \nThis is NOT business as usual in DC, this is NOT normal. \n\nThis republican administration has attempted to seize control over state election processes through executive orders and efforts to undermine civil rights legislation, as well as threatening the checks and balances established by the Constitution, such as disregarding court orders and altering federal regulations without proper authority.​​ The administration is using its current power to help billionaires continue to profit while striping away the services that help the most needy. \n\nWe need to stand up for due process, free speech, upholding court rulings, and the separation of church and state. The Founding Fathers established the principles of due process, free speech, and the separation of church and state through the First Amendment and other parts of the Constitution. These concepts were designed to protect individual rights and limit government power. \nWe have NO KINGS in America, yet Trump is acting like one. \nWe, the people, must rise up, and show that the power of the people is greater than the people in power. \n\nProtest Homework (aka, protest action steps)\n5 Calls App or Website, National Action Steps:\nScroll down to the LGBTQ+ section, as of right now there are 2 calls to make (to all 3 of your members of congress!):\n1. *“condemn RFK Jr’s False Report on Transgender Youth Treatment” and \n2. *“Oppose Efforts to Dehumanize transgender and LGBTQ+ people” \nIf you have time for another round of calls, please scroll to “executive overreach” and click:\n3. *”fight the trump administration’s defiance of the constitution and courts”",

Talk to your community, have fun and learn more about One Colorado.  \n\nWe’re thrilled to share that One Colorado will be attending 12 Pride events across the state this summer with even more on the calendar for this coming fall. From the Eastern Plains, through the Front Range, and to the Western Slope, we’re traveling far and wide to connect with LGBTQIA+ Coloradans and their families!\n\nAt each stop, we’ll be sharing what we’ve been up to from health equity and safe schools to voter engagement and trans rights. We also want to hear from you! Your stories, your needs, and your voices help shape the work we do every day.\n\nBut let’s also remember that Pride began as a riot, a powerful act of resistance led by trans women of color, fighting back against police brutality and demanding dignity and justice. Pride is a celebration, of course, but it’s also a call to action!\n\nWe hope you’ll walk with us in the continued fight for LGBTQIA+ rights. Whether you’re showing up, speaking out, or volunteering with us, your presence matters. Come say hi, get involved, and let us know how we can best support you and our community.\n\nCome connect with us at your local Pride!",

We then get it distributed right away to a local hunger relief recipient.\n\nThe work will happen in the farm's field in a variety of weather. It *will* involve bending/stooping at this event, some heavy lifting, and generally getting - at least a little - dirty. This will vary each time.\n\nRegistered volunteers will receive specific instructions about where to meet at the farm.",

    "description": "ALL OUR ACTIONS WILL BE PEACEFUL AND RESPECTFUL!!!\n\nThe last few years in America have seen a record number of bills that attack LGBTQIA+ rights, and now the attack from Trump is targeting transgender military members.\nAccording to USA Today, \"The Supreme Court has ruled against transgender people serving in the military, legitimizing President Donald Trump's discriminatory agenda.\nOn May 6, the nation's highest court decided to allow Trump’s trans military ban to take effect after a lower court had halted its enforcement. Because the decision was part of the “shadow docket” ‒ emergency appeals decided without full briefing or oral argument, and without any written opinion ‒ we don’t know why the justices ruled this way or how the vote was divided, although the three liberal judges on the court say they would have rejected the request that the case be heard.\" https://www.usatoday.com/.../supreme-court.../83499410007/ .\n\nJoin us at the Williamsburg James City County Courthouse, located at 5201 Monticello Avenue, Williamsburg, Virginia, on Friday, June 6th, at NOON to show our support for the LGBTQIA+ Community. It will be hot so please bring a cold beverage, a chair if needed, and take heat precautions, such as a hat or umbrella, etc...\n\nLOVE IS LOVE - SHOW YOUR PRIDE!!!\n\nAs with our previous events, the same rules apply. We will not engage with counter-protesters. If an issue arises, please notify one of the event organizers, who will be wearing Williamsburg JCC Indivisible t-shirts. We will not engage in any acts of violence or violation of any applicable laws or engage in civil disobedience. All actions will be peaceful. Everyone participating in this event will be required to behave lawfully to ensure the safety of event participants and will seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. We will obey the orders of authorized event marshals and law enforcement authorities. Event organizers will not be responsible for any injury or damage if any were to occur during this event. We will park in the Courthouse parking lot without blocking access lanes and will remove any trash that is left. We are committed to maintaining public health measures to practice safe protesting during these times. Please wear a mask and socially distance if that makes you more comfortable - weigh your own risk in attending. Follow all local safety guidelines at minimum, and any safety instructions from hosts that exceed local law.",

Our goal is to connect with as many people as possible, explain ranked choice voting, and encourage their support. Ideally, we hope some individuals will be interested in signing up to assist our efforts.",

We carry a legacy of proven tools, tactics, and collective courage from past movements like ours that can defend democracy and rekindle hope for a bright future.\n\nThis month, we’re partnering with Pramila Jayapal’s Resistance Lab, taking stock of these tools, and getting organized. Join us for MomsRising's May Community Zoom: Resistance Lab on **Thursday, May 22nd, 8:30 pm ET/ 5:30 pm PT,** where we’ll break down how to build the resistance we need.\n\nAnd the resistance starts with you! Moms and caregivers do the work of organizing everyday, whether we know it or not. We hold the worries about the present and the hope for the future, all while keeping on with caring for and loving on our children and communities. \n\nIf ever we needed a resistance movement full of moms and caregivers, it is now.

    "description": "Join MomsRising and Advancement Project for a VIRTUAL Teach-In on Supporting Immigrant Students and Families in Hostile School Environments. \n\nIn today’s polarized political climate, supporting immigrant students in public schools is more critical than ever. As national debates around immigration grow increasingly heated, schools, which should be sanctuaries of learning and belonging, can unintentionally mirror the hostility, fear, and discrimination seen in broader society. Without intentional collective efforts to support immigrant students and families, bias, harmful policies and practices, and a lack of cultural understanding can create environments where immigrant students feel unsafe, unseen, and excluded. Left unchecked, these hostile conditions not only harm students’ academic achievement and mental health but also weaken the fabric of school communities.\n\nIt will take all of us actively fostering inclusive, affirming spaces, in our schools and communities to counteract division, uphold the principles of dignity and opportunity, and ensure that every student, regardless of birthplace or status, has the chance to thrive, lead, and contribute to a stronger, more equitable future for us all because to be honest we are better together.\n\n\nWe can’t wait to share space with you. Don’t forget to RSVP to join and receive event updates including a post event resource guide. \n\nJoin us virtually on Tuesday, June 10th at 6 PM CST / 7 PM EST.",

Hear from a few advocates and local faith leaders, and bring a donation (nonperishable food item or a monetary donation) for a local food bank if you’re able! \nThe Luzerne County Chapter meeting will begin immediately following the social hour at 6pm.**\n\nFamilies and communities look out for one another. From our schools and healthcare providers to local organizations, we all strive to ensure that everyone not only gets by—but has the chance to thrive. That responsibility includes our elected officials.\n\nRight now, Congress is moving quickly on a reconciliation package that could gut vital safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP, shifting the burden to states and local communities. These cuts would endanger families, strain local budgets, and jeopardize Pennsylvania’s ability to meet basic needs—all to pay for tax breaks for billionaires.\n\nWe call on Representative Rob Bresnahan to honor his commitment to protect Medicaid and SNAP. The Republican-proposed cuts could strip healthcare from hundreds of thousands of people in our region and take food off the tables of families across the 8th District—all to benefit the ultra-wealthy.\n\n**Doors will open at 4:30pm, and we'll have plenty of tacos and other goodies for all!**",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

Though technically they make appointments at 9 am, many get to the site early (at 7:30 am or before) to wait in line. NOVA volunteers may bring clipboards and registration forms, but we don't have a table at this event. This event is a good one for NOVA volunteers who like to be proactive at starting conversations about voting.\n\nVolunteers will check voters' registrations, register new voters, update voter registrations, and help voters apply to vote-by-mail.\n\n\nPLEASE CHECK THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE SHIFT YOU SIGN UP FOR AS EACH SHIFT IS AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION",

Join the rally from 12-2 to stand in solidarity with students, faculty, elected officials, advocacy groups, and the community to protest the BOR's dismantling of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies and practices at our state's campuses.  Come out and defend what is truly at stake: the dignity, safety, and educational opportunity of thousands of Georgia students and the reputations of our state universities.  \n\nMeet from 12-2 pm at the Trinity St entrance at 270 Washington St SW, Atlanta 30334. Spread the word and register for updates. #CommmitToInclusiveExcellence #OwlGate \n\nMARTA is your best bet as parking can either be difficult to find, or expensive.  This is a peaceful protest.",

The agenda for this meeting is targeted to get us into action:\n\n    We will be planning and preparing our event for No Kings day, a nationwide day of protest on June 14th.  Will we host our own action or will we join forces with other groups for a larger event?  Help us decide that, and more.\n\n    We will begin organizing into committees (communications, events, legislative action, bannering, etc.) and discussing what each group will tackle next. \n\nEveryone is welcome!

    "description": "In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings. NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nJoin us in Ballwin, MO for a national day of protest. Bring your signs and your energy, and let's remind the Trump Administration that there are no kings in America.\n\nThis will be a peaceful, nonviolent protest. Families are welcome!\n\nTime: 11:30AM-1:30PM\n\nLocation: Manchester Road in Ballwin (Manchester and Weidman, although check back for the final location)\n\nPlease, for your own safety, stay out of the roads during all protests. This protects you and our movement.\n\nThis is an outdoor event, and we value your safety. In the event of dangerous weather, we reserve the right to cancel this event. Please check the Mobilize website two hours prior to the event to ensure that the event is proceeding as planned.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",

We'll have trainers from Faith in Minnesota share effective messaging basics to keep in mind using the Race Class Gender Narrative techniques. \n\nRace Class Gender Narrative is equal parts empirically-tested messaging, organizing strategy, and creative communications approach fused together to motivate and mobilize people to reject faux populism, fear- and dog whistle-based messaging and embrace progressive solutions and the kind of policies and government that can implement them. This training will teach you:\n\n– What is Race Class Gender Narrative and why we should use it.\n\n– How to create winning messages.\n\n– Share research-based messaging that meets our current moment.\n\nIndivisible groups in Minnesota have incorporated these skills and offered these trainings for years to help improve communications around issues that can be tough. It will change how you approach conversations both online and in-person with friends and neighbors.\n\nThis event is in-person only, and will not be recorded.",

    "description": "Hilo: Trump is No King! June 14 from 10am - 12pm. Hilo Bayfront, makai side. Join us for a Nationwide Day of Defiance on Flag Day. Trump is having an over the top military parade in Washington, DC for his birthday. Let’s not have that be the center of attention. We’ll create action everywhere else. We want this mobilization to be our biggest turnout yet! Come with your American flags, signs, energy, and friends & family.  Bring plenty of water and sunscreen. Extra signs available. \nDonald Trump wants tanks in the streets and a made-for-TV display of dominance for his birthday. A spectacle meant to look like strength. But real power isn’t staged in Washington — it rises up everywhere else.\"",
