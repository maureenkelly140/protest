    "description": "Democracy Day Sioux Falls\nPolitical Rally in Support of Veterans\nFood / Cash Donation Drive to support South Dakota DAV\nFriday, June 6th, 2026 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm\n12th & Kiwanis Sioux Falls SD\n\n\nConcerned citizens plan to gather again, this time to speak out and stand up for Veterans. A rally and food drive is planned for Friday, June 6th, 2025. Community members are invited to gather for Democracy Day Sioux Falls from 5:00 to 7:00 pm on 12th and Kiwanis in Sioux falls. Rally goers are encouraged to bring signs showing their support, along with a non perishable food donation for Vets in need.\nOrganized by the same group of anonymous citizens of the April 19th rally and food drive at Van Eps park, an event provided a 3,400 pound food donation and raised over $4000.00 given to Feeding South Dakota. Hopes for a larger turn out at the USS South Dakota Battleship Memorial are high with the event planned to also remember the historic events of June 6th, 1944 and the invasion of Normandy. \n‚ÄúThe memorial is sometimes overlooked for its significance in history. It was called Battleship X to protect its identity in the Pacific theater, because of its success in combat, defending freedom during World War II, ending the fascist regime of the Axis Powers. It‚Äôs appropriate to gather there on the anniversary of D-Day to demand better care and protections for our Service Members today.‚Äù  organizers said.\nNon-perishable food items and cash donations will support local South Dakota DAV Arthur H. Muchow Chapter No.1. Those interested in donating but not able to stay for the rally will be able to drive through and drop off donations. A DAV trailer will be at the site for the duration of the event.\nThe public is called to make an impact in awareness of the concerns of the community. For more information on volunteering or attending an event page is available on Facebook, find it by searching #DemocracyDaySiouxFalls\nVolunteer sign up can be found at https://forms.gle/yU7XxgfwiAWog4TE8\n###\nContact: QUGSiouxFalls@gmail.com\nQueen City Underground on Facebook\nwww.facebook.com/events/2439234963100362",

    "description": "We‚Äôre reaching out because Sarasota County students urgently need your support.\n\nSarasota County Schools has drafted changes to its Student Code of Conduct that would remove key protections for all students, including our LGBTQ youth. This harmful action will send a message that some students are less worthy of safety and respect. Sarasota County Schools has no basis to remove language that affirms the ability for LGBTQ students to ‚Äúattend school in an environment where all students and adults are treated equally‚Äù. \n\nDespite what the district says, this is not about compliance or any legal requirement. There are no State or Federal laws or any Executive Orders over the last 100 days, requiring school districts to remove any of these student protections. This decision will simply result in more harassment, increased bullying instances, and strips our students of the right to attend a safe school.\n\nNow is the time to speak up. We need you to attend the school board meeting, share a public comment, and show that this community stands up for all students.\n\nWe urge Sarasota County Schools to focus on creating safe, fair, and welcoming schools. This is the bare minimum to ensure every student wants to attend school, feels safe, and can focus on their academics. Sarasota County Schools must prioritize student safety and learning, not subject our kids to harassment and discrimination.",

We demand our medical institutions do not comply with anti-trans, unconstitutional attacks on young people's healthcare. We demand Phoenix Children's Hospital reinstate this life-saving, life-affirming care trans youth deserve and need to thrive. \n\nThis action is a Speak Out. Our community will gather at the corner outside of Phoenix Children's Hospital and listen to youth, community leaders, and medical professionals speak to the importance of gender-affirming care through speeches and chants. We also encourage attendees in our community step up to the mic and share their own stories. Attendees are encouraged to bring signs, and friends!\n \nThis action is co-organized by The Feminist Front, Young Feminist Party, and Queerizona.

    "description": "Join local Indivisibles in a pre-library board meeting protest, and sign up to speak against a local man who has been repeatedly requesting LGBTQIA+ material censorship at the Waupun Public Library. \n\nBackground: A man who goes by Mr Gappa, from the Waupun, WI has sent multiple letters and has been speaking at library board meetings vehemently pushing for the removal of any library material with reference to or portrays the LGBTQIA+ community or lifestyle. He has now spoken to the Waupun city council and is smearing the name of one of the board members spouse as he continues to push back against this censorship request. \nThere was a large showing for speakers, almost unanimously in opposition to the censorship, at the February board meeting. Since then, he has sent yet another letter to the board calling for his own religion be used as a guide for content, material and displays at the PUBLIC library. \nLet‚Äôs help support the overwhelming consensus among the community that censorship does NOT belong in our public libraries.\nPlan to meet at the Waupun Public Library, 123 S Forest St, Waupun, WI at 4pm. Protestors should line the street on both S Forest and E Brown streets. Board meeting begins at 4:30pm. If you wish to speak, you must sign in prior to the meeting start - there is limited seating in the board room (a capacity of about 100 seats). \nParking is limited and is mostly street parking.",

    "description": "The Hands Off Coalition of Indivisible Twin Cities, MN 50501, Women's March MN, and the AFL-CIO MN are organizing the Twin Cities metro area No Kings event on June 14!\n\n12:30PM - Gather together at The Commons in downtown Minneapolis before the march.\n\n1:30PM - March with us from The Commons down Nicollet Avenue and ending at Loring Park.\n\n2:30PM - Rally in Loring Park, Minneapolis. From inspiring speakers, to bands and activities for all ages, we'll be gathering with neighbors to say NO KINGS.\n\n**In America, we don‚Äôt put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We‚Äôve watched as they‚Äôve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They‚Äôve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\nüö®**On Saturday, June 14, we‚Äôre taking to the streets nationwide. We‚Äôre not gathering to feed his ego. We‚Äôre building a movement that leaves him behind.**üö®\n\n\nThe flag doesn‚Äôt belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We‚Äôre not watching history happen. We‚Äôre making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we‚Äôre showing up everywhere he isn‚Äôt‚Äîto say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

This year, we will honor the many men who fought and died that day, and we will continue their fight ‚Äì this time on America‚Äôs shores and in America‚Äôs streets.  On Friday, June 6, veterans and their allies will join once again for a rally in front of the Marin Veterans Memorial Auditorium.\n\nThis rally will take place on the same day as the primary gathering on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., as well as in state capitols, large cities and small towns. Veterans and military family members are being fired by the thousands from federal jobs. Their healthcare is being gutted. Their benefits are under siege. We rally to:\n\nDefend veteran and military family member employment in the federal workforce;\n\nStop the privatization and weakening of the Department of Veterans Affairs; and\n\nHold political leaders accountable for policies that harm veterans and their families.\n\nThe rally will include firsthand accounts from veterans and their providers on the difficulties they are experiencing in receiving and providing care. \n\n\n\n[Photo by ProBonoPhoto.org/Stephanie Mohan]",

    "description": "Representative Pramila Jayapal has worked with experts in the fields and developed a \"Resistance Lab\" course. You can join the next one on June 1st virtually [here](https://www.mobilize.us/pramilaforcongress/event/775585/). But for people in the Seattle area, we are planning an in-person session to watch the training together. The course includes group exercises, which would be much easier and fun to do together in person. \n\nWe will be meeting at a Seattle Public Library branch in the University District area. Please note, this event is NOT hosted, sponsored, or endorsed by The Seattle Public Library. Any views that are discussed in this meeting are not a reflection of The Seattle Public Library‚Äôs views.\n\n**This in-person meeting has limited capacity. We kindly ask you to only sign up if you plan to attend the session. If your plan changes, please cancel your registration promptly so that others can sign up and we can prepare accordingly. **\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact us via this [form](https://forms.gle/GCAi5a6m45SvyP1g9).\n\n### What is the Resistance Lab? \n(copied from [Representative Jayapal's page](https://www.pramilaforcongress.com/the-resistance-lab))\n\nThe Resistance Lab is a series of trainings that are developed specifically for this moment. We look at how non-violent movements around the world have responded to leaders who seize power in authoritarian ways and the most effective tools and tactics to utilize in these moments.  We offer frameworks to understand this moment at home, and incorporate interactive conversation with others to help create community and build our resistance movement.   \n\nThe Resistance Lab was developed with experts who have researched and studied democratic backsliding around the world as well as in the United States and the non-violent movements that have emerged to challenge those authoritarian leaders.  We also draw from many toolkits for effective tactics and frameworks as well as from Pramila‚Äôs own background leading successful organizing movements for economic and social justice for two decades.  \n\nOur goals are to help people understand how democracies fall and the most effective resistance movements that have challenged authoritarians and dictators; to turn anger, fear and frustration into action in the short-term while also preparing for a coordinated resistance movement for the longer term; and to build community across the country that can help grow our movement.  At the end of the day, we want to get people strike-ready and street-ready and make sure we protect our people, our freedoms and our democracy.  \n\nWith Trump and his MAGA billionaires doubling down on their attacks on the economic livelihoods of people to thrive and on our democracy, we can‚Äôt afford to sit this moment out. This is about building real power together. And it starts with you. \n\n\n### Interviews about The Resistance Lab\nHere is [an interview on The Rachel Maddow Show](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/-there-s-no-other-savior-or-option-resistance-to-trump-mobilizes-as-americans-have-seen-enough-235933765750) about it.\n\nStacey Abrams talked to Representative Jayapal about it [on her podcast](https://youtu.be/0c2QmHu2Flo?si=9f0Jl7kPX4EZni-u&t=337).",

The marchers will take S. Huron south to Virginia St., and \nVirginia St. to the suspension bridge. There will be at least one station along the route for water and first aid. After the bridge,\nthe march will end on 11th St at Bobo the Elephant where will have a short rally and then filter into Pride. Those who don't march can\nalso drive to  the endpoint for the final rally. The event will be from 12:30-2:30.\n\n**In America, we don‚Äôt put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We‚Äôve watched as they‚Äôve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They‚Äôve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\nüö®**On Saturday, June 14, we‚Äôre taking to the streets nationwide. We‚Äôre not gathering to feed his ego. We‚Äôre building a movement that leaves him behind.**üö®\n\n\nThe flag doesn‚Äôt belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We‚Äôre not watching history happen. We‚Äôre making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we‚Äôre showing up everywhere he isn‚Äôt‚Äîto say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "The Texas Legislature isn‚Äôt done limiting Freedoms and endangering the Lives of Texans.\n\nTexas Senate Bill 2880 (SB 2880), known as the Women and Child Protection Act, is a legislative proposal that expands upon the state's existing abortion restrictions, particularly targeting the distribution and use of abortion-inducing medications and the sharing of legal abortion access information. For more information on this harmful legislation, see the following link: https://bit.ly/12ProtestLIT\n\nAs of May 16, 2025, SB 2880 has been passed by the Texas Senate and is awaiting further action in the House State Affairs Committee.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs just the bill that attacks women. They are passing bills targeting LGBTQia+ people, the freedom to read, and the freedom to learn.\n\nOn June 14th, 2025, let‚Äôs remind them that we are more than Texans. We are Americans protected by the US Constitution.\n\nIf Texas succeeds, other states will do the same. The country will do the same. It is time for us to inspire the nation to rise up.\n\nTo do this, we must create a striking image to be shared around the country and the world, regardless of the law. To say in one voice, ‚ÄúWe Dissent.‚Äù\n\nThe red cloak of the Handmaid is more than a symbol of oppression. It has emerged as a symbol of strength. It is the uniform of the Resistance. On the 14th, we will not be an amorphous crowd. We will be an army.\n\nAll genders are welcome to join. We are protesting oppression in all forms (reproductive health, gender discrimination, freedom of speech, freedom to read, and freedom to learn). ***To ensure uniformity and a striking image, please order the following Handmaid‚Äôs costume (under the same link file for a description https://bit.ly/12ProtestLIT ). We understand it is not the cheapest. It is lightweight (it WILL be hot), we all need to be the same shade of red and we all need to have our faces shielded appropriately. If you cannot afford this particular costume, we do have some sponsorships available. You can also sponsor a handmaid. See instructions for sponsorships in the link. We are certain you will have the opportunity to wear your costume again. This will be a long fight for freedom. If you already have a costume you want to wear, you can send pics to 12indivisible@gmail.com for approval.\n\nPLEASE REVIEW ALL THE MATERIAL IN THE LINK BEFORE SENDING QUESTIONS\n\nAfter our March of Dissent, the No Kings Rally, hosted by our sister organization, Indivisible FTW, will be held in the park from 12-2PM.",

    "description": "Wow! What a great location for a standout! About 8 of us tried it out on Friday, May 2, and around 17 of us came out on 5/16. What a blast! LOTS of engagement with motorists!\n\nThere's a full-size sidewalk on the west side, and a narrow sidewalk (kind of like the narrow sidewalk at Mountain Park Rd.) on the east side. \n\nThere's lots and lots of traffic passing by. Southampton Road (Routes 10/202) is heavily traveled northbound and southbound, and the Mass Pike eastbound and westbound is below. Lots of honks and thumbs up and waves...and a few folks flying middle fingers. We smile and wave at them all! \n\nWe'll have letterboards prepared for the lower part of the overpass fencing - the photo shows how that will look to folks passing on the Mass Pike. We're interacting with motorists on the Mass Pike, and on Southampton Road. We've discovered that the magic happens when we smile and wave to people!\n\nCome when you can, and leave when you must. You needn't be present for the entire 1 1/2 hours.\n\n### How to Get There\n\nThe address \"130 Southampton Road, Westfield\" will get you just north of the overpass. \n\n### Parking\n\nWe can't park in the Southampton Rd breakdown lane. There are vacant business properties north of the bridge, and it seems that parking would be OK there.\n\nIt looks like The Wealth Technology Group has vacated their office at 130 Southampton Rd, but the internet says that other businesses are located there, so please be mindful if you decide to park there.\n\n### Etiquette!\n\nWe don't give the finger to people who give the finger to us, or who say unpleasant things. We smile and wave to them, too. \n\nWe may see a counter protester. If so, the best thing to do is just ignore them and spend our time and energy waving to motorists. Let's keep things 100% non-confrontational in words and body language.\n\n### Other Stuff\n\nPlease take everything you brought away with you, and leave the site totally clean.\n\nIf rain is predicted, we'll cancel. If we cancel, you'll receive an email notification.\n\n### A Few Requests\n\nWe've found that roof rake sections make wonderful flagpoles and banner poles. If you have a roof rake (or 10‚Äô-15‚Äô light metal poles or conduit) to contribute, we'll be happy to take it off your hands!\n\nAnd, if you have an extra 3' x 5' American flag you're not using, we'd love it if you'd pass it on to us!\n\n\nphoto: Rob Robertson",

    "description": "As part of No Kings event at Burlington Waterfront, we will stage a Die-In to demonstrate the lethal impact of T**** administration budget, program cuts, foreign policy, immigration policy, and its very existence on people and programs, in the US and around the world.\n\nBy lying still and quiet on the grass with our tombstone signs, we‚Äôll show the actual health, safety, and life impacts the actions of the current administration is having on us and the world. After lying or sitting in silence (for at least 15 minutes, but maybe more depending on overall No Kings event schedule) we will rise and silently arrange our tombstones as a graveyard (they will have a small stake taped to them), to remain displayed for the rest of the day.\n\nThis type of protest was used effectively during the Vietnam war, the AIDS crisis, and five years ago at the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement. These have already been done in 2025 Utah and NYC at 50501 events. The photo above from the NYC protest shows how dramatic and educational this will be.\n\nMore details, including tombstone creation parties, timing, recommended dress, will be emailed to you as the June 14 day-long event shapes up. \n\nThis is a peaceful and silent protest.",

They‚Äôve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\nüö®**On Saturday, June 14, we‚Äôre taking to the streets nationwide.

We raise some larger Indivisible banners and spell out a short message in 2 foot tall letters. Then, we stand and wave at passing cars and chat about the movement and anything else. We stay about 2 hours, covering some high traffic time like rush hour. It's an easy and fun way to spread your message and meet fellow activists.\n\nThis week's will be at the Market Street overpass of I-205. You can park on Market street nearby and walk at most 2 blocks up a gentle hill.",

This is a nonpartisan event, veterans and civilians, come and show the country that all of us in Clay County care about our veterans and we DO NOT support the cuts to the VA, the attempt to privatize many services, as well as the Veteran jobs that are being eliminated without warning. 1/3rd of all federal jobs are filled by veterans; our veterans deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and this is not happening.\nThis is a peaceful rally; do not engage with anyone displaying hostile or disrespectful behavior.

    "description": "Truth and Democracy Coalition Launches New Website to Fight for Democracy, Counter Divisive Propaganda, and Defend the Constitution at https://TruthandDemocracyCoalition.com\n\nPress Release May 17, 2025\n\nTruth and Democracy Coalition Launches Campaign to Bring Americans Together Around Shared Values. Organizer Richard Procida Produces Programs Designed to Cross Ideological, Religious, and Political lines to Undermine False and Divisive Narratives.\n\nThe Truth and Democracy Coalition to hold a press Conference on March 30, 2025, at 1 pm PDT at Liberty Plaza in Whittier, and online on March 31st at 10 am at https://Tinyurl.com/TDCPressConference\nLOS ANGELES, CA, May 17, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On March 30, 2025, at 1 pm PDT in person and on March 31st at 10 am online, Richard Procida will present The Truth and Democracy Coalition's new website, programs, and events designed to reach across ideological, religious, and political lines to build the movement to save democracy. The in-person press conference and community meeting will be at the Liberty Community Plaza at 14181 Telegraph Rd, Whittier, CA 90604-2554. Register for the online press conference at https://tinyurl.com/TDCPressConference\n\nAmericans are a propagandized people. Political extremism and the widespread dissemination of divisive propaganda have pitted Americans against one another. All sides have been propagandized. Everyone is impacted. Conservatives, liberals, and radicals all consume propaganda.\n\nThe Truth and Democracy Coalition is committed to protecting and strengthening democracy in an era of growing division and disinformation. We bring together individuals from all walks of life‚ÄîRepublicans and Democrats, radicals and moderates, Socialists, Liberals, and Conservatives‚Äîto uphold and defend the Constitution while strengthening the foundations of democracy. Our mission is to build a broad, diverse, and engaged movement that empowers individuals and communities to stand against authoritarian threats, defend democratic values, and promote truth in public discourse.\n\nRichard Procida, the founder of the Truth and Democracy Coalition, will present the web page, explain the programs, and answer questions. He is available for media interviews and can be contacted at (562) 665-3317 and RichProcida64@Gmail.com\n\nAuthor and attorney Richard Procida founded the Truth and Democracy Coalition to unite Americans, counter disinformation, defend the Constitution, and fight for democracy. His vision is to bring conservatives, liberals, and radicals together around shared values. Democracy, freedom, and the rule of law, for example, are foundational American values.\n\nAs an attorney who studied constitutional law at American University and authored a textbook on foreign comparative constitutional law, he intuitively recognized the looming threat to democracy and freedom posed by the propaganda war. At a time when many were saying that Trump was \"just a symptom\" of a larger racist system, Mr. Procida began writing and speaking at rallies calling for impeachment and warning Americans about the threat to democracy posed by the Trump Administration. He started a podcast called Democracy Under Fire which later became The Truth and Democracy Podcast, and wrote articles for LAProgressive.com, BuzzFlash.com, and DemCast.com. He held annual events on January 6th to remember the assault on the capital and prevent it from happening again.\n\nMr. Procida studied social science and communications with a minor in the Study of Women and Men in Society at the University of Southern California. He studied law at American University, Washington College of Law in Washington, D.C. He also co-authored a survey of laws and social attitudes toward sexually explicit materials in various countries and regions of the world (Social Issues in Global Perspective: Pornography, Lexington Books (2003)). He currently leads the Truth and Democracy Coalition.\n\n# # #\n\nOther Media\nimg\nContact Information\nRich Procida\n\nThe Truth and Democracy Coalition\n\nWhittier, CA\n\nUnited States\n\nTelephone: 5626653317\n\nEmail: RichProcida64@Gmail.com\n\nWebsite: https://tinyurl.com/TDCPressConference\n\n###\n\nhttps://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/522883/truth-and-democracy-coalition-launches-new-website-to-fight-for-democracy-counter-divisive-propaganda-and-defend-the-constitution-at-httpstruthanddemocracycoalitioncom",

    "description": "Come out to show that ordinary people can raise their voices against the chaos and destruction of this Administration. Help remind folks that they, too, can stand up for their beliefs - and that there's lots and lots of people who aren't on board with the \"cruelty as entertainment\" behavior of Trump and Musk and the GOP.\n\nFamily-friendly!\n\n### How to Get There\n\nThe address \"9 Mountain Park Rd, Holyoke\" will get you there if you're using Waze. (Mountain Park Road runs off Route 5, and is not accessible from I-91.) People have reported that some GPS systems bring you right under the bridge, but on I-91. That‚Äôs annoying!\n\nPlease park on the side of the road before the bridge. We can't park on the bridge.\n\n### Other Stuff\n\nPlease take everything you brought away with you, and leave the site totally clean.\n\nIf rain is predicted, we'll cancel. If we cancel, you'll receive an email notification.\n\nWe may see a counter protester. If so, the best thing to do is just ignore them and spend our time and energy waving to motorists. Let's keep things 100% non-confrontational in words and body language.\n\n### A Few Requests\n\nWe've found that roof rake sections make wonderful flagpoles and banner poles. If you have a roof rake (or 10‚Äô-15‚Äô light metal poles or conduit) to contribute, we'll be happy to take it off your hands!\n\nDonations...we've purchased banners and grommets and flags and zip ties and bungee cords, and we'll be getting more. We‚Äôve purchased 20‚Äù x 30‚Äù letter boards for messaging we can change. All this costs $$$. We'll have a bucket for donations, and if you could throw something in, that'd be great. And if not, that's perfectly OK, too - your presence is what's really important. See where the money's going! https://tinyurl.com/IN-SLWMProtestTeamFinancials\n\n\nphoto: Rob Robertson",

    "description": "*East Portland Indivisible proudly supports the Rise for Racial Justice Rally*\n\nRemember George Floyd.\n\nRemember the life that was stolen because of systemic racism and state sanctioned violence.\n\nRemember how we responded, transforming our outrage and grief into an uprising that rocked the entire nation.\n\nRemember that we‚Äôre not done. Our journey has only just begun.\n\nTo amplify the movement for Black lives, Brown Hope has convened a grassroots movement called We Are The Bridge: Rise for Racial Justice, a week of action between May 15 ‚Äî May 24 in recognition of George Floyd‚Äôs murder five years ago. This week of action features a series of community gatherings, culminating in a historic rally on May 24th at Revolution Hall and a peaceful march through downtown Portland and the Burnside Bridge.\n\nWe march for George Floyd. Breonna Taylor. Quanice Hayes. Kendra James. Eric Garner. Mike Brown. And so many others. We march because this injustice and suffering should never happen again. It should not take the deaths of more Black people for our elected and business leaders to do the right thing.\n\nA grassroots coalition of Portland-based organizations have formed We Are The Bridge: Rise for Racial Justice‚Äî including Brown Hope, 50501 Portland, the Coalition of Black Men, the Oregon Working Families Party, Outside In, SURJ PDX, BIPOC Rise Moor Healing Center, Radical Rest, Veterans For Peace PDX Chapter 72, Restorative Roots Project, and Momentum Alliance. Together, we are calling for immediate action to expand opportunities for our local Black community to thrive‚Äî economically, socially, and spiritually.\n\n**Participants to the Rally - please join us in bringing donations of snacks, water, other basic mutual aid supplies**\n\nHere‚Äôs the complete list of events organized for our week of action:\n\nNonviolence and De-escalation Training: 6pm on Thursday, May 15 at openHAUS (5020 NE MLK Blvd). Facilitated by the Portland Peace Team, this training teaches how to foster peace during moments of conflict using the CLARA de-escalation method.\n\nCommunity Grief Circle:12:30pm on Saturday, May 17 at Alberta Park (1905 NE Killingsworth St). Experienced facilitators will lead activities that help attendees release emotional wounds connected to George Floyd‚Äôs murder and racial violence. Concludes with an optional community potluck.\n\nKnow Your Rights Training: 6pm on Thursday, May 22nd, Online. Facilitated by the National Lawyers Guild, the workshop covers constitutional rights related to activism and police interactions at first amendment events.\n\nWe Are The Bridge Rally and March: noon on Saturday, May 24th at Revolution Hall (1300 SE Stark St). A rally featuring Black and Indigenous leaders, followed by a peaceful march through downtown Portland with a moment of silence on Burnside Bridge.\n\nAs we remember George Floyd‚Äôs life and legacy, we must acknowledge that we have the responsibility to act. We Are The Bridge is encouraging supporters to help us build power by donating to local racial justice organizations and promoting the campaign on social media by using the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #BeTheBridge.\n\nIn 2020, Portland became a beacon of hope for the whole nation and the entire world thanks to 100 days of sustained action in solidarity with Black lives. This year, We Are The Bridge: Rise For Racial Justice is a collective antidote to the disease of moral bankruptcy currently plaguing our country. By participating in this week of action, we can make 2025 a defining year for Portland and our commitment to justice.\n\nWe are the heartbeat of this movement. Let‚Äôs work together to inspire a lasting movement of change.\n\nFor more information, visit: https://linktr.ee/BrownHope\n\n#BlackLivesMatter #BeTheBridge",

The training is virtual by Zoom (link provided after registration).\n\nThey need to hear from you. Connecting with our people is vital right now. Many are frightened or nervous or confused and they need to know that they are not alone. You can be the one that makes a difference. Register for a training today and be a hero tomorrow.",
