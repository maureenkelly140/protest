    "description": "We're doing an intensive water quality look across the Mud Creek watershed. For three weeks, we'll be taking samples specifically looking at bacteria pollution in Mud Creek. \n\nWe'll meet at the Ingles parking lot (address below), where MountainTrue staff will give you materials and teach you what you need to know. From there, we'll all go grab samples from different locations and then meet back at the Ingles parking lot by 2PM to drop samples off, so MountainTrue staff can bring them back to the lab to process. \n\nBring lunch and a small cooler if you have one. We'll provide sampling materials and gloves. We'll be working off of Google Maps, so it's helpful to have that app on your phone, or partner with someone who does. Wear clothes and shoes you don't mind getting wet or dirty.\n\nMeet-up location: We will meet at Tunnel Rd. Ingles (1980 Asheville Hwy, Hendersonville, NC 28791\n\n\nPhoto Release & Waiver of Liability: all participants must read and agree:\nThere are certain risks inherent in any outdoor activity. Each participant, member, and guest must check the box below and in doing so, agrees to release from liability the leader(s), MountainTrue, its Partners, Affiliates, and members for any accident, injury, illness, or personal loss which might occur while participating in this activity or while traveling in any vehicle during this trip. Each participant further agrees to abide by the rules and regulations of MountainTrue concerning safety, to follow instructions of the leader(s), and not to become intentionally separated from the group.

    "description": "Come out to show that ordinary people can raise their voices against the chaos and destruction of this Administration. Help remind folks that they, too, can stand up for their beliefs - and that there's lots and lots of people who aren't on board with the \"cruelty as entertainment\" behavior of Trump and Musk and the GOP.\n\n### Recent DOT Visits\n\nA Department of Transportation employee has visited twice in the past three weeks to ask that people NOT attach anything to the fencing. On 5/20, he parked and waited until everything was removed from the fencing. It seems reasonable to expect that DOT enforcement will continue.\n\n### How to Get There\n\nThe address \"9 Mountain Park Rd, Holyoke\" will get you there if you're using Waze. (Mountain Park Road runs off Route 5, and is not accessible from I-91.) People have reported that some GPS systems bring you right under the bridge, but on I-91. That’s annoying!\n\nPlease park on the side of the road before the bridge. We can't park on the bridge.\n\n### Other Stuff\n\nPlease take everything you brought away with you, and leave the site totally clean.\n\nIf rain is predicted, we'll cancel. If we cancel, you'll receive an email notification.\n\nWe may see a counter protester. If so, the best thing to do is just ignore them and spend our time and energy waving to motorists. Let's keep things 100% non-confrontational in words and body language.\n\n### A Few Requests\n\nWe've found that roof rake sections make wonderful flagpoles and banner poles. If you have a roof rake (or 10’-15’ light metal poles or conduit) to contribute, we'll be happy to take it off your hands!\n\nDonations...we've purchased banners and grommets and flags and zip ties and bungee cords, and we'll be getting more. We’ve purchased 20” x 30” letter boards for messaging we can change. All this costs $$$. We'll have a bucket for donations, and if you could throw something in, that'd be great. And if not, that's perfectly OK, too - your presence is what's really important. See where the money's going! https://tinyurl.com/IN-SLWMProtestTeamFinancials\n\n\nphoto: Rob Robertson",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n**🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨**\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.** Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\n_A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values._",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\nIn addition or expressing our dissent, we are asking all participants to bring  a donation of school supplies for our local Family Resource centers or no-cook non perishable food items for our local community kitchen.  \n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.  This is a family friendly event.*\n\nPlease follow Hardin County Democrats on Facebook for a detailed event map and updates.  Parking will be available in the Justice Center lot.  Gather at the Quince lot by 3:30.  The March to City Hall will begin shortly after 3:30.  For those not able to march, there should be a small amount of parking spaces at the City Hall lot.",

    "description": "Trump’s administration is in full-on power grab mode, shredding laws, defying courts, and handing control of the country’s financial system to a billionaire crony.

Do not park in their lot or engage with their employees and customers. Bring a sign, flag and good spirits, Stay on the sidewalk & allow pedestrians to pass, Do not jaywalk across Mayfield Road (police will be watching), Use the crosswalk just west of Tesla, Don't block driveway entrances or exits, Don't harass Tesla customers or employees, Do not argue with counter protesters, PROTEST PEACEFULLY. Watch for peacekeepers in yellow vests and immediately report any disturbances to them. Follow any instructions from Lyndhurst Police.

While we don't know if they fly deportation or incarceration flights out of TC (they claim not to at this time), we stand in solidarity with over 50 cities across the nation where Avelo operates and where these human trafficking flights happen.\n\nJoin us to protest Avelo in Traverse City.

    "description": "American democracy is 250 years old. We fought against a monarch at the time of our founding and we don’t put up with would-be kings now. \n\nWe are joining the NO KINGS national day of action one day early. In Auburn we are celebrating democracy on Friday night and on Saturday we will join the Juneteenth celebration of freedom in downtown Auburn.\n\nThis action is in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\nWe are taking to the streets on Friday. Most of the nation will take a stand on Saturday for No Kings Day!\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nSay no thrones, no crowns, no kings.\n\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind our event is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Join us starting at 9:30am ET to write postcards, talk about the news, and hear from candidates and political leaders. If this is your first time joining this group, please sign on at least 15 minutes before the speaker start time listed below. \n\nPlease answer the registration questions accurately and completely. Also, having your full name displayed will facilitate admission from the waiting room. We may request clarification from you in the waiting room chat. \n\n**Michael Lange will join us at 11:00am on Tuesday, May 27.**  Michael is a writer, researcher, organizer, and political strategist who will be joining us to discuss the demographics of the NYC Mayoral race.  Born and raised in New York City, Michael last visited our zoom in 2023 as we tried to make sense of the results of the 2022 elections. His Substack newsletter, \"The Narrative Wars,\" is a must-read for anyone interested in NYC politics. These recent issues make for provocative reading: \"The Only Hope of Stopping Andrew Cuomo,\" \"Are New York Liberals a Dying Breed?,\" and \"New York City's Generation Gap.\"\n\nWe strive to build community, educate voters, and use our Sharpies to write to save democracy together. Write postcards with us or just join the conversation. If you need help getting started with postcarding, please visit our [FAQ](https://markersfordemocracy.org/postcarding/postcarding-faq).\n\nIf you are with the media and want to attend, you must notify us at markersfordemocracy@gmail.com at least two hours before the start of the event. All discussions are off the record.\n\nThis event is co-hosted by [Markers For Democracy](https://markersfordemocracy.org), [Downtown Nasty Women Social Group](https://linktr.ee/DNWSG), and [Team Min](https://linktr.ee/teammin\n).",

Vernon Trail, ending his trek at the Lincoln Memorial, where these inspiring words from the Gettysburg Address are permanently etched in the wall of the south chamber, reminding us of our eternal responsibility to the fallen to protect ideals of the country they fought and died for:\n\n“It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion, that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”\n\nEvery dollar makes a difference!\n\nPick your pledge amount for each mile, multiply it by 10 miles, and make your donation!\n\nWhether your pledge is $1 a mile, or $10 a mile, or $20 a mile, we are so grateful for the INW community!\n\n➜ Let’s keep building! \n\n➜ Let’s keep fighting!",

This event will utilize our military, our soldiers, and our weapons as mere props for his personal celebration, funded by taxpayer dollars with an estimated cost of over 48 million. We need to make it clear that there are no thrones, no crowns, and no kings in America.\n\nThis planned event is more than just his birthday celebration; it is a direct challenge to our democratic values and our Constitution. This administration has repeatedly defied court orders, unlawfully terminated federal employees, deported legal residents, and U.S. citizens without due process. Moreover, he has obstructed women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and minority rights while undermining freedom of speech and freedom of the press.\n\nWe stand united in our refusal to accept this abuse of power. Nationwide protests are being organized to support democracy and the rule of law. Let us show our solidarity and make it clear, \"No Kings in America, and this is not your flag, but America's Flag!\" Together, we can stand against tyranny and protest the values that define our nation.\n\nJoin us in this important fight for democracy! Let's make some good trouble!",

    "description": "This event is in Lakeland, Polk County! \n\nJoin us to tell legislators to stop the cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, and other vital programs. Hold elected officials accountable and Protect Democracy!\n\nMembers of Congress need to hear from us right now, but calling and emailing is not enough. They need to see us! Bring your signs and letters to hand deliver.\n\nHere’s a list of just some of the awful things House Republicans voted in favor of. Use it to hold Republicans accountable, educate your neighbors, and keep the fire burning for the hard work still ahead:\n\n*Empty stomachs for millions of kids and seniors thanks to the largest cuts to food assistance (e.g. SNAP) in US history\n\n*Higher home electric bills driven by huge cuts to clean energy investments that fund most new power sources\n\n*14 million people kicked off their healthcare due to major cuts and restrictions on Medicaid and other healthcare programs, like the Affordable Care Act\n\n*More challenges to holding Trump accountable after Republicans slipped in a one-sentence provision that would make it extremely difficult for courts to hold Trump administration officials in contempt for violating court orders\n\n*Tax breaks for people buying gun silencers (“Who asked for this? The assassin lobby?” asked one Democratic lawmaker)\n\n*Millions of patients denied cancer screenings and reproductive care due to the defunding of Planned Parenthood and banning of abortion coverage under ACA insurance plans\n\n*Hospital layoffs, service cuts, and closures thanks to historic cuts to vital healthcare funding\n\nA core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to peaceful action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events.",

We are already paying for a more than $36 Trillion deficit right now.\n\nOne other thing they snuck into the bill in the dark of night:\n\n**\"No court of the United States may use appropriated funds to enforce a contempt citation for failure to comply with an injunction of temporary restraining order in no security was given when the injunction was issued...\"**\n\n\n*Write or Call to tell your Congressperson how disappointed you are that the voted for this monstrous bill that hurts everyone except the billionaires and highest earners.*",

No losers. Only heroes.\n\nWe stand in unity against any rhetoric or policy that disrespects or undermines the value of our veterans. Recent and ongoing cuts to the Veterans Administration by the current administration are a betrayal of those who have risked their lives for our country. These cuts threaten access to essential healthcare, support services, and dignity for the very people who defended our freedoms.\n\nMake your message heard!\n\nBring signs that honor the sacrifices of our veterans and speak out against the disrespect and defunding of those who served. We encourage messages that include:\n\n“No Cuts, Just Care”\n“Honor All Who Served”\n“D-Day Heroes Deserve More”\n“Veterans Are Not Political Pawns”\n“There Are No Suckers or Losers—Only Heroes”\n\nLet’s turn our collective outrage into action—respectfully, powerfully, and visibly.\n\nLet’s show our local veterans and their families that we see them, we honor them, and we will fight for them just as they once fought for us.\n\nStand for our heroes. Stand against injustice. See you there.\n\n#FightingforDemocracy #SupportOurVeterans",

This is an opportunity to pierce through our current news (and disinformation) ecosystems with concise pro-democracy ideas, messages, and calls to action.\n\nThis is a non-violent and non-confrontational event.

    "description": "Join us for our eighth rally in Sarasota to support Social Security. Meet like-minded people who are standing up for our rights. Help save the Social Security we paid for and our families are paying for.\n\nThis is a local, Sarasota-based, grassroots rally by Indivisible Sarasota.\nWe meet outside the Social Security office, at the intersection of Siesta Drive and South Tamiami Trail. (see map)  The big sign there is for the restaurant, Flemings.\n\n*** NOTE: We've made this rally even earlier than before to avoid the heat...\nThe rally is in the shade and during morning rush hour, at 9 AM, so it will be relatively cool but with a lot of visibility.\n\nParking is right across Siesta Drive in the empty shopping mall parking lot.\nBy persisting week after week, we are showing the people of Sarasota that we are in this for the long term and will persevere as long as necessary.\nExpect lots of supportive honking of horns.\n\nBring your own sign about Social Security or any other topic related to the resistance against the MAGA attack on our democracy.\nSee you there!",

    "description": "Celebrate our LGBTQ+ family, friends, and even strangers by showing our support for their rights!\n\nThis is meant to be a peaceful march of solidarity leading up to the day's pride events located on the waterfront in the parking lot behind Whiskeys by Bishop park. \n\nWe will have a short rally at city hall with local LGBTQ+ advocates discussing the concerns of rights for the community. Then we will have a peaceful and playful march with music, bubbles, and colorful attire down the sidewalk of biddle toward oak, crossing and ending at the event that begins at noon. There, you can choose to stay and partake in festivities! \n\nPlease note: the group, Right to Life will be present as they have been in the past. Based on my information, they march about the perimeter of the event throughout the day. \nI think it would be great to counteract that group by having some from ours also take a lap periodically throughout the day. But this idea is absolutely rooted in the fact that those who chose to participate need to be 100% peaceful, not instigate, and understand we come from a group feeling of love and inclusion! We are here to support our allies, not target them!\n\nWear as much pride attire as desired!\nSigns can be geared towards love, LGBTQ+ rights, and support!",

    "description": "Join Sherman Smith, Editor-in-Chief of the Kansas Reflector (a States Newsroom affiliate), for a vital conversation on the growing restrictions facing journalists at both the state and federal levels. From blocked access to legislative chambers in states like Kansas, Texas, and New York, to increasing hurdles at the White House, Sherman will explore how these trends threaten press freedom and public accountability. Drawing on recent developments—including legal battles over content regulation, the role of the White House Correspondents’ Association, and media shakeups like the CBS News Director’s resignation—this webinar confronts a chilling question: What happens to democracy when reporters are silenced? Don’t miss this urgent discussion, hosted by one of the nation’s leading voices in independent journalism.",

NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",

    "description": "Native voices have the power to influence energy policy in Apache and Navajo counties.  Join us to learn how contacting your county's decision makers can protect our precious water and air.   In the face of drought and climate change it is up to citizens like us to speak out for our planet.  We have more power in local matters than on national policy so raise your voice locally to protect what we care about most.  Our families, our commuites and our lands.  \n\nNavajo and Apache Counties are revising their renewable energy ordinances and need input from community members who want to protect our water and air.  They need to hear why renewables are a better choice than coal and other dirty energy sources.   Learn from our panel of presenters about the impacts of dirty energy on our communities and why large scale renewable energy is safer for our families and our planet.  You will also learn how you can address local decision makers like the County Board of Supervisors and Planning and Zoning Committees to ask for clean energy ordinances that protect our air, water and our history.",

This event will uplift AAPI voices, inspire civic participation, and energize attendees to take action from volunteering to voting and beyond. Together, we’ll explore how local organizing connects to broader fights for justice in education, the economy, and our courts. Hear from community leaders, break down barriers to the ballot box, and leave ready to strengthen our neighborhoods for the long road ahead. Let’s build power and pride together.",

Last year’s participants enjoyed our smorgasbord of actions including letter/postcard writing, textbanking and using social media to amplify progressive voices. \n\nThis year, we most cordially welcome back seasoned Civic Sunday participants and look forward to meeting newcomers, in the hope to grow and strengthen our community. We all know that the political landscape has changed, so we will be looking to garnish our smorgasbord of volunteer opportunities with occasional “dishes” of information on critical issues.  Civic Sunday is one way we can protect our freedoms, resist the assaults we face on our liberties, and look forward to building a more perfect union FOR ALL. You can count on a supportive group dedicated to turning anxiety into action. And you can count on some yummy refreshments :)\n\n\nIf you haven’t heard of it, Swing Left is a national network that helps people find high impact ways to support Democratic candidates. We focus on the most flippable races as an important step towards ensuring the progressive change needed to create a more inclusive and equitable government and society.",

But one thing is clear—we need to turn up the pressure. We need YOU.\n\nHuizenga voted for the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill”—a cruel piece of legislation that would rip healthcare from millions, take food from the mouths of children, and give massive tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy. We cannot let this stand.\n\n📢 This is your moment. Join us EVERY FRIDAY at NOON. Bring your signs, your voice, your friends.\n\n📞 Call him daily. ✉️ Flood his office with letters. 💬 Demand a meeting. Let him feel the fire of a community that refuses to be ignored.\n\nThis is not politics as usual—this is a fight for dignity, justice, and the future of our country.\n\nAll actions are rooted in nonviolence. We show up with courage, and we de-escalate, even when met with opposition. Stand firm, stand proud, and stand together.\n\n\n*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Walk/Ride in the parade!\n\nThe McLennan County Democratic Party will have a float in the Waco Juneteenth Parade, Saturday 14 June. We need up to 19 volunteers to sign up to decorate our pickup truck and then ride/walk in the parade. We need 4 volunteers to take turns marching with our banner. The parade Route runs from the Heritage Square staging area, 311 Austin Ave in front of City Hall to the old Campus of Paul Quinn Campus, 820 Elm Street, a nice little walk on a warm and sunny day.\n\nThose walking and riding with the float are encouraged to wear We the People - March for Democracy T-shirts if you have one or Democratic Party or Civil Rights related T-shirts and hats are an important thing to wear.\n\nSign up on Mobilize!\n\nMcLennan County Deputy Voter Registrars Needed for the Parade!\n\nIn addition to those volunteering with the float, we need 4, able bodied, McLennan County credentialed Volunteer Deputy Voter Registrars to circulate through the assembly area and then walk the entire parade route registering voters. We always get a few. Smile and walk up to people and ask them if they need to register. These are two, 2 person teams one on each side of the street. Bring your supplies, good shoes and wear hats. The We the People shirt or Neutral Patriotic or Civil rights T-shirts and hats are good for this, nothing that says Democratic Party or promotes a candidate. Lots of walking. \n\nIf you are not a DVR yet, and want to register voters, go down to the McLennan County Elections office, 214 N 4th Street, Suite 300 and become one. You will walk out in 20 minutes or less with all the information/supplies you need, a Volunteer Deputy Registrar. \nContact Jane Comer or Mary Mann or Debra Ucci at 254-301-7648 to volunteer to register voters.\n\nHere are some details:\n\nSchedule:\n\n8:45am - Truck arrives, signs in and moves to our spot in the line up.\n\n9:00am - Volunteers arrive, decorate the truck and get ready to roll.\n\n9:45am - After checking for voter registrations in the Assembly area, DVR's head down the route.\n\n10:00am - Parade steps off!\n\n11:00am - Parade is over. Should be back to the Assembly area.\n\nIf you know you intend to walk, you might arrange to leave a car at the end of the parade near Paul Quinn. Space on the Truck for the ride back to the start will be limited.\n\nIt is always extremely hot, drink water, be lightly dressed and comfortable.\n\nSlots are limited for this.  Sign up now.  If it is full come out and cheer as we go by.",

    "description": "Join me for a postcard writing party, the first in a series of events in support of the November 2025 elections in two sister swing states, Virginia and Pennsylvania. We will be writing cards to infrequent voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning, which will be mailed in mid-October for maximum impact. Both of these will be watched very closely as bellwethers for the 2026 midterms, and a strong showing by Democrats will make a strong statement against Trump and MAGA.\n\nVirginia's Republican governor is term-limited, so that's an open seat, and the Democrats have a strong candidate who has a good chance of winning if we get our voters out: it also has a razor-thin majority in the state legislature that we need to preserve. \n\nIn Pennsylvania, there are three State Supreme Court justices in a retention election: if they are not retained, the PA Supreme Court will be deadlocked, with two Democratic and two Republican justices. Since it is very likely that there will be litigation after the 2028 election, it is vital that we hold on to this court.\n\nI will bring postcards, scripts, & writing supplies: you bring your enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket and an appetite for a drink or snack from the best cafe in Reno.\n\nThink about it: if you help get a voter to the polls, that is an important step towards creating a more inclusive and equitable government and society. Looking forward to seeing you!",

    "description": "Join the McLennan County Democratic Party, Indivisible Central Texas and our local partners and organizations all across the nation for NO KINGS, A Nationwide Day of Defiance from noon – 1:30 pm at Waco’s Freedom Corner, Valley Mills Drive and Waco Drive.\n\nSaturday, June 14th is an important day. It is Juneteenth our national holiday celebrating the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in Texas. It is Flag Day and it is the 250th Birthday of the United States Army. \n\nCentral Texans and people throughout the nation will be gathering to celebrate our history of independence, freedom and progress. Donald Trump has decided attempt to hijack this day and make it about him with a soviet style military parade to celebrate his birthday. Donald Trump wants to be a king or a dictator. He wants to be our ruler, and he wants us to be his subjects. Kings have birthday parades. Donald Trump wants tanks in the streets and a made-for-TV display of dominance for his birthday. A spectacle meant to look like strength. But real power isn’t staged in Washington — it rises up everywhere else. It comes from you! In America we have no Kings, and we are subject to no one. Join us to say NO KINGS!",
