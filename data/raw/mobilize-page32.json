Unfortunately, Representative Derrick Van Orden has yet to hold an in-person town hall meeting with his constituents.\n\nWhether it’s rising costs, economic uncertainty, or the future of programs like Medicaid, Social Security, and SNAP, the decisions made by Congress in the coming weeks will impact the lives of all Wisconsinites, including families and small businesses here in Western Wisconsin. Rep. Van Orden’s constituents deserve answers to their questions and concerns.\n\nPlease join our grassroots coalition for a town hall with special guest Representative Mark Pocan on Saturday, May 31 at 10:00 AM CT at the Pablo Center in Eau Claire. Seating is limited.\n\n*Rep. Derrick Van Orden has also been invited to attend this event.",

    "description": "Come together with us for an urgent and powerful evening of community, conversation, and resistance.\n\nFounded by seasoned civil rights leaders, Sanctuary of the South (SOS) is more than an organization—it’s a movement. SOS exists to build justice and liberation through communal love, support, and resistance. We serve immigrant, LGBTQ+, and BIPOC communities throughout the South by providing low bono legal services, community sanctuary spaces, and seed funding for grassroots projects. We are a refuge—a place to heal, to organize, and to build the world we deserve.\n\nAt this Town Hall, we’ll come together to:\n\n-Build community and exchange ideas on what this moment in history demands of us\n\n-Share tangible ways to fight back against the rise of authoritarianism\n\n-Explore how to protect our people—immigrants, queer and trans folks, Black and brown communities—through mutual support and collective action\n\n-Invite you into the SOS ecosystem, where there is no divide between the work and the people it serves\n\nSOS explicitly rejects the nonprofit industrial complex, refusing all state and major foundation funding. We answer only to our people—not to funders, not to boards. That makes us nimble, real, and grounded in what truly matters.\n\nIf you’ve been looking for a movement home rooted in the South and powered by fierce love, this is your invitation. You are welcome here. SOS is for you. It is for all of us.\n\nLet’s gather, let’s organize, and let’s build together.\n\nRSVP now and join us.",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We also want to hear from you! Your stories, your needs, and your voices help shape the work we do every day.\n\nBut let’s also remember that Pride began as a riot, a powerful act of resistance led by trans women of color, fighting back against police brutality and demanding dignity and justice. Pride is a celebration, of course, but it’s also a call to action!\n\nWe hope you’ll walk with us in the continued fight for LGBTQIA+ rights.

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

    "description": "We are going to be in Boulder for Pride and we need your help!  Please sign up to volunteer with us at our table.  Talk to your community, have fun and learn more about One Colorado.  \n\nWe’re thrilled to share that One Colorado will be attending 12 Pride events across the state this summer with even more on the calendar for this coming fall. From the Eastern Plains, through the Front Range, and to the Western Slope, we’re traveling far and wide to connect with LGBTQIA+ Coloradans and their families!\n\nAt each stop, we’ll be sharing what we’ve been up to from health equity and safe schools to voter engagement and trans rights. We also want to hear from you! Your stories, your needs, and your voices help shape the work we do every day.\n\nBut let’s also remember that Pride began as a riot, a powerful act of resistance led by trans women of color, fighting back against police brutality and demanding dignity and justice. Pride is a celebration, of course, but it’s also a call to action!\n\nWe hope you’ll walk with us in the continued fight for LGBTQIA+ rights. Whether you’re showing up, speaking out, or volunteering with us, your presence matters. Come say hi, get involved, and let us know how we can best support you and our community.\n\nCome connect with us at your local Pride!",

From city blocks to small towns, from courthouse steps to community parks, we’re taking action to reject authoritarianism—and show the world what democracy really looks like.\n\nWe’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.\n\nMeet like-minded allies at the Great Lakes Mall (park on side with Barnes & Noble Bookstore) and let's tell this administration and their leaders that we will not abide kings in this country.  Bring your signs and voices to proclaim freedom in the USA.\n\nPlease park on the side near Barnes & Noble Bookstore and walk towards Rt. 20.  We will protest along the southside of Rt. 20.\n\nWe will have SB1 petitions to sign, if you have not signed one by then.\nWe will have peacekeepers, crossing guards, legal observers, chanters, voting registration and well-deserved camaraderie.\n\nStay on the sidewalk, off the grass.  DO NOT JAYWALK.  Choose your sign wording carefully as this is a family-friendly event with children.",

If turnout is high, we’ll continue our monthly meetings at this location (or at another public venue). \nPlease park on Second Street (in front of the Library) and enter the meeting room on the side of the building facing Church Street (across from Jerusalem Lutheran Church). \nAGENDA: Our group’s approach is informal. Come join with like-minded people for an evening of sharing and planning! Bring your ideas, your experiences, and your hopes for the future of our country. What have you read about today’s political scene? What have you done to “aid the cause”? If you’re comfortable sharing, please do. Some members just want to be present, which is fine. Ultimately, we believe that sharing among like-minded people provides comfort to those who may be alone and sparks ideas and activism in others. Let’s share, plan, and act! The goal is to achieve a better future for our children and grandchildren . . .",

We will update when they are finalized**\n\nRally, March, and Donation Drive\n\n**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Join us to support the campaign to renew Seattle's successful Democracy Voucher Program! Since 2015, the DVP has changed local elections for the better—giving everyday people a bigger voice, making it possible for more diverse candidates to run, reducing the influence of big money in politics, and more.\n\n**Now it's time to renew funding for the program—and we can do that by approving Proposition 1 in the August primary election.**\n\nWe're kicking off a summer of voter education to secure the future of this groundbreaking program. At a time when our democracy and communities are under threat, Proposition 1 can make Seattle a leader in ensuring that everyday people have the voice we deserve in our elections.\n\n**Will you join us?**\n\nWe're planning a fun-filled evening of community and campaigning, with activities including a photobooth, banner-painting, and more, as well as plenty of ways to engage. We'll also hear from a powerful lineup of local leaders and members of our coalition. \n\n**You don't want to miss this event!**",

    "description": "We’re weeks out from the NYC primary election, and the stakes are HIGH to block Andrew Cuomo and elect a mayor who will deliver on an affordable city, prioritizing the needs of working families above the demands of the rich and well-connected.   \n\nNYC doesn’t need to replace one power-hungry, scandal-ridden politician with another. We can elect a mayor we can all be proud of, but we must do it together! With multiple progressive candidates running, the NY WFP is taking on the challenge of keeping progressives united, asking voters to rank ALL candidates on the Working Families Slate—Adrienne Adams, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani and Zellnor Myrie—to make sure that a Working Families champion is the next mayor of New York City. \n\nBecause we need candidates for EVERY office fighting for working people, we’re also encouraging voters to vote for Justin Brannan for Comptroller and Jumaane WIlliams for Public Advocate—two progressive champions who are committed to fighting for working families. \n\nTalking with voters face-to-face is THE most impactful way you can make a difference in this election. Join us to knock doors, engage with voters, and build our power across the city!\n\nNo experience necessary—your field captain will provide training and materials at the beginning of every canvass. RSVP and tell a friend to double your impact!",

But we also need local, more frequent rallies that show locals that they're not alone in this fight.\n\n**When we realized the DHS/ICE field office is in our neighborhood, we decided it would be the perfect place for an ICE-specific RhRR!**\n\nEvery Thursday @ 7:00 am, we'll gather on the south east corner of Central and Monte Vista, right in front of the ICE Field office.\n\n**STAY ON THE SIDEWALK!** It's public property and we've a right to be there. Be sure you **DO NOT BLOCK** access to the building—that means cars as well as people.\n\n**Please make ICE-specific signs**, as we're here to show the busy morning commuters that they are not alone and the ICE staffers that We The People care about due process for everyone.\n\nSpread the word. Come join us. All the details you need are at [RhRR.us](https://rhrr.us/#museum-district).\n\nLove this idea and want to start your own Rush-hour Resistance Rally in your area? Groovy!

One of the biggest issues we've identified has been housing, we want to see funding for free legal representation for evicted tenants, relocation allowances for folks who have to relocate due to rising costs and property tax subsidies for home-owners. \n\nJoin us on Saturday, June 7 from 11AM-1PM for an important community discussion on the state of affordable housing in rural West Tennessee and what we can do together to prevent gentrification and preserve the legacy of rural West Tennessee.

    "description": "PEACEFUL sign holding rally\n\nOn Thursday, May 22, 2025, we are showing up to defend our right to due process guaranteed to all people on US soil by the 5th and 14th amendments of our Constitution. People are being taken from their homes, from their jobs, from their cars, from their appointments with immigration and being sent to detention centers and/or to a prison in El Salvador without due process. This administration has admitted to making mistakes, yet makes no attempt to return these folks to the United States. This administration has stated they will look into deporting American Citizens. Who will be next? Will it be someone you love? Will it be you?\n\nMake signs, bring cowbells and big voices. Bring a drink or snack if needed but be sure NOT to litter. Note that nearby restroom facilities are limited.\n\nWe are exercising our right to peacefully hold signs on public sidewalks. Our route will remain clear for pedestrian traffic and we expect all participants to refrain from bringing drugs or weapons while upholding local laws to ensure a peaceful, impactful event. We will remain peaceful and not engage with hecklers. \n\nIf any individuals attempt to disrupt the rally by recording, shouting, or engaging with you, please remain composed. We suggest using cow bells or whistles or singing your favorite patriotic song to gently deter any disturbances; our focus must remain on our cause. Disruptors seeking confrontation will be ignored. Our chants will continue to amplify our message.\n\nCan you join us?",

    "description": "Big events with thousands of people are great. But we also need local, more frequent rallies that show locals that they're not alone in this fight.\n \n**So we made one for our neighbors in Moon Valley, and we'd love to have you attend!**\n\nEach Wednesday @ 7:30 am, we'll gather at [Serafina Coffee Roasters](https://www.serafinacoffeeroasters.com) on 7th St & Coral Gables to grab a beverage, walk across the parking lot to the sidewalk, and show the busy morning commuters that they are not alone.\n\nPeak traffic time seems to be from 7:45 to 8:30a. Yes, it's already hot in Phoenix, so plan accordingly. \n\nSpread the word. Come join us. All the details you need are at [RhRR.us](https://rhrr.us).\n\nLove this idea and want to start your own Rush-hour Resistance Rally in your area? Groovy! [Let's make that happen!](https://rhrr.us/#start-your-own)",

    "description": "Join us on Friday, June 6 from 12:00 to 1:00 at the corner of Paseo del Pueblo Norte and Civic Plaza Drive for a peaceful protest. Bring your protest signs and a folding chair if you can’t stand for an hour or so. Please stay on the sidewalks, don't step into the street and only cross at designated crosswalks.\n\nA massive rally is planned in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere on June 6, the 81st anniversary of D-Day, to protest cuts at the Department of Veteran Affairs and call for the protection of veterans' benefits and jobs, which are being slashed by the Trump administration's efforts. Nearly 30% of the federal workforce is made up of veterans, the proposed job cuts will disproportionately affect that population.\n\nVeterans, family members and anyone who supports the service and sacrifice of the armed forces are encouraged to join us in support of former service members who work for the federal government and for the preservation of VA benefits.\n\nRallies are a great way to meet other like-minded community members. They remind us that we aren’t alone and it feels good to be civically engaged. Action is the antidote to despair. We guarantee you will feel better about the state of affairs when you leave this event.\n\nPlease follow all posted rules and traffic laws when attending a rally. Safety is always our first priority.

    "description": "Big events with thousands of people are great. But we also need local, more frequent rallies that show locals that they're not alone in this fight. \n\n**Since I live in the neighborhood, I thought having one on the Melrose Curve seemed like a great idea. So I did it!**\n\nEach Wednesday @ 7am, we'll gather at Copper Star Coffee in midtown Phoenix to grab a beverage, walk down to the rainbow crosswalk across 7th Avenue, and show the busy morning commuters that they are not alone.\n\nPeak traffic time is from 7:30 to 8:30a. Yes, it's already hot in Phoenix, so plan accordingly. Bill from [Copper Star](https://copperstarcoffee.com) has graciously (and excitedly!) offered to let us use the shop as a cooling off and bio-break place as needed.\n\nSpread the word. Come join us. All the details you need are at [RhRR.us](https://rhrr.us).\n\nLove this idea and want to start your own Rush-hour Resistance Rally in your area? Groovy! [Let's make that happen!](https://rhrr.us/#start-your-own)",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

Protect our federal workers! Dora Lievow writes, \"Inspired by other communities who have done this, I’ve initiated an action on May 17. Many cuts made by the Postmaster General, a Trump appointee from his first term, have already stressed our Post Office workers. The current regime is advocating further cuts, closing local branches and privatization.\n\n\"Last week in Chapman Park I gathered many signatures for a thank you card to be delivered on Saturday, May 17. I will be collecting more signatures this week.\n\n\"I am hoping for a good showing of Audacity members at the Rockland Post Office at 11:30 a.m. May 17th so we can present our card and show our support before the P O closes at noon.\" Following that 11:30 AM rally, participants will march down the sidewalks of our Rockland downtown to participate in our regular 12 Noon demonstration.\"",

We will gather on the public sidewalks and grassy banks along the road margins at the intersection of Minnesota State Highway 7 and County Road 101 in Minnetonka where we will display our hand-made signs in view of evening rush hour traffic at a busy intersection. The convener is experienced in protesting at this location in all kinds of weather. The Highway 7 corridor includes communities with some of the highest voter turnout and civic engagement in the entire country. Residents here span the whole political spectrum of the United States of America, but we all agree that there are no kings in America. In between elections, we remind elected officials that no one is above the law and every elected official is accountable to the people under the Constitution. We affirm that American values of democracy, freedom, and rule of law and opposition to Trump's unaffordable policies are broadly supported in our community. \n\nThe Wednesday 21 May 2025 event is the third in a planned long series of Minnetonka Wednesday Weekly Protest events that will continue indefinitely on each Wednesday afternoon through summer, autumn, winter, and into next year as needed until further notice.",

Whether it's generating family walking groups for physical fitness, encouraging youth attend summer day camps, looking forward to reopening the Theatre for Cultural events!  The Queens Night Market is just the start.  May is AAPI and Jewish American Heritage Month.  Business is very important to this community, and I think a great opportunity to come out and vend that Entreprenurial gift you have!  While out, I also encourage you stop by and support my candidacy with your signature that I may get on the ballot.  My Campaign focuses on Aging Gracefully Well regardless of your age and all that supports achieving that goal (ie., small business, education, housing, healthcare and more) and doing so strategically smart in the neighborhoods and City I so love!  My campaign has also added the fight for Anti Semitism and all isms under the umbrella of Public Safety.  That includes Ageism this Older Persons Month.  Looking forward to meeting you to share and learn how you envision District21 and more.  Til then!",

    "description": "NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political positions, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies. They think they rule—but we are bigger than even their worst aspirations.\n\nDonald Trump is planning a military parade in Washington, D.C. on June 14. This display of might is intended to intimidate opponents and solidify his image as a strongman on our dime—we won’t stand by while that happens.\n\nInstead of allowing this military parade to be the center of gravity, we will make action everywhere else the story of America that day: people coming together in communities across the country to reject strongman politics and corruption.\n\nAlongside local organizers, partners, and leaders from across the pro-democracy & pro-worker movement, we will demonstrate organized people power that outpaces any authoritarian aspirations.",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Join us in going door-to-door to talk to Democratic voters in the Central Valley, in Ceres (CA-13). \n\nIn 2024 Adam Gray flipped the seat by only 187 votes. Let's talk to Democrats now to hold CA-13 in 2026, as we take back the House majority!\n\nArrive in Ceres at 9:30 am to pick up supplies, get assigned turf, and quick training. Then we will head out to knock doors, issue canvassing and voter registration.\n\nIf you need a ride, we have carpools available. If you want to drive, please let us know. Just bring your smartphone or tablet and a charger, a little water, sunscreen, comfortable shoes, and a smile.\n\nRead more about how Adam Gray always puts the Central Valley first - https://gray.house.gov/\n\nIf you haven’t heard of it, Swing Left is a national network that helps people find high impact ways to support Democratic candidates. We focus on the most flippable races as an important step towards ensuring the progressive change needed to create a more inclusive and equitable government and society.",

She says these types of actions DO make a difference. Castor says this is a pivot point and we need to stop the Trump administration before it gains more power. \n\nBring your choice of paper or stationery to write letters on the issues that are hurting Republican lawmakers most: cuts to SSI, Medicare, Medicaid, and FEMA. Or write about another issue that is near and dear to your heart. \n  \nSnacks and beverages will be served, including wine. Feel free to BYOB. We hope to see you on June 6th!",

From inspiring speakers, to bands and activities for all ages, we'll be gathering with neighbors to say NO KINGS.\n\nIn America, we don’t put up with would-be kings. NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.\n\n\nLearn more about this nationwide effort here:\nhttps://www.nokings.org",

    "description": "No Kings! Let Freedom Fly in downtown Brattleboro on Flag Day! \n\nOn Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets again nationwide, standing together in love and unity. Our movement is building - to support justice, a sane society, a stronger world. We stand declaring that the power belongs with the people. That’s US! That’s each and every one of YOU! \n\nCome out and make some noise with us in Brattleboro! We’ll gather at Centre Congregational Church at 3:00 pm, parade with The People's Resistance Marching Band and Becky Graber’s street choir to end up on the Common. \n\nOnce at the Common, protestors will be invited to engage with local groups and organizations at tables for information-sharing and grassroots strength building. You'll also be entertained by circus and street performers PLUS more music! We will celebrate the diversity that makes America shine! All flags welcome.\n\nTogether we call for justice, OUR Constitution to be upheld, and an end to executive overreach. We honor the flag of the United States, a symbol of freedom and national solidarity. We honor the rights of every person within its borders.\n\nWe are no longer interested in simply protesting the damage coming out of Washington, D.C., which affects every individual, we are here to stop it. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, \"A time comes when silence is betrayal.\"  \n\nWe will not be silent, we will gather on the streets on June 14 and every day to follow in our neighborhoods, in collaboration. “The work of bringing people together in mutual recognition and cooperation is never really done”. --Archbishop Anthony Broglio\n\nCo-hosted by Indivisible Brattleboro and Brattleboro Area Action, this partnership is bound by a shared commitment to nonviolence, inclusion, and democratic participation.",

    "description": "🔥We are facing a national crisis. Congress is selling us out by slashing Medicaid, SNAP funding, and more. Why? To give more tax cuts to billionaires.\n\n💸 But the services they’re slashing aren’t theirs—they’re ours. Our communities are paying the price while the Trumps and Musks of the world cash in. It’s not just about money—it’s about power. Trump’s administration is targeting everybody who isn’t part of the 1%—veterans, kids, seniors, farmers, immigrants, transgender people, and political opponents. All to consolidate power and reward their allies.\n\nOn Feb. 25th, Representative Jeff Crank voted to move forward with H. Con. Res. 14 which cuts Medicaid benefits in order to give billionaires a tax cut.  According to Rep. Crank “I think there’s groups out there that are trying to scare people… to try and scare people into believing that there’s going to be all these massive Medicaid cuts. And that hasn’t been the case, that’s not the intention of anybody here, is to cut people off of Medicaid.”   However, H. Con. Res. 14 calls for cuts of $880 billion over the next decade from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees health care spending programs including Medicaid and Medicare. \n\n·         Data shows 19% of Crank’s 5th Congressional District are enrolled in Medicaid\n·         Medicaid covers 6 in 10 nursing home residents\n·         1,174,868 people in Colorado are on Medicaid\n·         Medicaid covers 1 in 3 children in Colorado.\n·         36% of births in CO are covered by Medicaid\n·         65% of adults in CO on Medicaid are working\n·         55% of non-elderly Medicaid enrollees in CO are people of color\n\nIndivisible Colorado Springs and the El Paso County Democrats are holding a Medicaid Budget Cut Panel Discussion so we can clear up misinformation, hear your stories and concerns, and share resources and actionable next steps for our Colorado Springs community to be empowered considering the fear these cuts are creating in our community. We look forward to seeing you there.\n\nWhen: June 10, 2025, 6-8pm (doors open at 5:45pm)\nWhere: IBEW Local 113, 2150 Naegele Rd, Colorado Springs, CO 80904\n\n*Space will be limited to 200 people (max capacity).\n💻You can also join via zoom. More info to come soon.\n\nSign up now and bring a friend!\n\nPre-submit questions for the Medicaid Panel here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEU4rCJ8X2L6KwCJ0GO2xR0VtLv8ukiMG7dEangLGqADl-pw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=108081298308261841541",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets in Fort Collins. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. **We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.**\n\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

But under the Trump administration’s so-called “efficiency” plan, VA hospitals and services are facing massive rollbacks that put veterans’ health and lives at risk.  \n\nJoin the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 2152 at a rally to fight to keep their VA hospital open and fully staffed.\n\n📉 83,000 VA jobs slashed – cutting doctors, nurses, and support staff\n\n💰 $2 billion in contracts canceled – including cancer care, suicide prevention, and veteran burial programs\n\n 🧠 Mental health services gutted – just when demand is highest\n\n 🕒 Benefits backlog growing – 134,000+ veterans will face delays in receiving disability and educational aid\n\n🚦A Note About Signs: this rally is to show respect, support and gratitude for VA employees. We ask that signs for this rally focus on veterans and the importance of maintaining the VA. For example, “I love the VA”  “Protect Vets”  “Protect VA employees” “I support the VA” “Vets love the VA”  We appreciate your cooperation.\n\n🚦And a note about parking.  Please park on the street and not in the parking garage.  Save the garage parking for our Veterans.",
