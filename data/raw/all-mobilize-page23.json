The world is watching and we want to build on the energy of our rally on April 5.   Join us to SPEAK OUT NOW! and show that the administration does not have a mandate for their harmful actions. \n\nWe are gathering for a peaceful protest the first and third Saturdays of each month in Pittsboro. ***We will now gather at the sidewalk in front of the Chatham PTA Thrift/True Value Hardware and walk up to and around the old courthouse.** Bring signs. Bring friends, family, and neighbors. Meet like-minded people, network with others who are concerned for our democracy and SPEAK OUT NOW! \n\nThere are lots of public parking spaces around town.  Please park where you like, and meet us to march up to the Old Courthouse.  We don't want to clog up any of the business parking lots, but if you do park in a business lot, please try to patronize that business :-)\n\nOur first two events in April and May were positive and show the need for this community event!  Join us and let's grow the opposition!",

    "description": "This Mother’s Day, we gather not just with flowers—but with fire in our hearts and justice in our voices. On Saturday, May 10, we rally in honor of all mothers:\n🌸 The ones who raised us in freedom,\n🌸 The ones who are raising the next generation,\n🌸 The ones who dream of becoming moms someday—and deserve the right to choose when and if they do,\n🌸 And the mothers enduring the fallout of failed policies: economic hardship, crumbling healthcare systems, attacks on reproductive freedom, and schools stripped of resources.\n\nThis is also for the mothers of immigrants, of children wrongfully detained, and of communities silenced by cruelty and neglect. It’s for every woman fighting to give her children a better future—and for the daughters who are demanding one.\n\n🚨On Saturday, May 10 from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, we’ll be at Good Trouble Corner (McBean & Valencia Blvd, Santa Clarita) to stand together in solidarity.🚨\n\nWe’re not waiting for change. We are the change. We’re building a movement where every voice counts and every family matters.\n\nA core principle behind this event is a commitment to nonviolence and community care. We expect all participants to uplift each other and de-escalate when needed—we lead with peace, love, and strength. We recommend all participants review our safety and security resource before your event: https://indivisi.org/safety\n\n💌 More Info: www.indivisibleCA27.com\n📧 Contact Us: CA27indivisible@gmail.com\n\nBring your signs. Bring your stories. Bring your love for the women who made you. ✊💐\nLet’s show up for all our mothers—past, present, and future.",

    "description": "Join Sister District Puget Sound to hang out with like-minded folks and sign up to postcard for Lily Franklin!\n\nRunning for the Virginia House of Delegates | District 41 | Challenger\n\nFive generations of Lily Franklin’s family live in southwest Virginia (SWVA). This is her home, and she wants it to be the best possible place to raise a family, live, and retire.\n\nLily’s SWVA roots go deep, she knows that Virginia doesn’t end in Charlottesville and has shared in the pain of neglect with her neighbors. Lily and her brother both graduated from Northside High School. She completed a bachelor’s degree in political science at Longwood University while her brother started a small business in Christiansburg.\n\nLily can put a proven record, established contacts, and in-depth knowledge of the inner workings of our Commonwealth’s government to work for SWVA. She knows the problems we face in SWVA because she lives here. She can bring concrete solutions to these problems from Richmond because she’s worked there.\n\nWe'll be back at the always kid and dog friendly space, Old Stove Ship Canal, rain or shine! \n\n600 W Nickerson St, Seattle, WA 98119\nhttp://www.oldstove.com/shipcanal\n\n2-4PM, 5/18/25\n\nWe hope to see you there! \n\nCheers,\nSister District Puget Sound",

    "description": "Join Indivisible Lambertville New Hope (ILNH) at our first Field Team 6 event!  While some ILNH Indivizzies will be marching in the Saturday, May 17th Lambertville-New Hope Pride Parade, we’ll be among the crowd registering voters! After a brief check in (Lambertville meetup location given after completion of registration), we'll mingle among the parade onlookers and register voters!  We'll be out until noon and then meet back at our morning gathering location to debrief and congratulate ourselves on a job well done!  We ask that you wear hats, shirts and/or buttons that make clear that you’re a liberal. We'll provide you with everything you need to invite democrats to register to vote. \n\nAbout FT6:\nField Team 6 (FT6) is a volunteer army on a simple mission: Register Democrats. Save the World. FT6 is working to restore the Democratic trifecta, to empower Congress to pass game-changing voting rights, abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights, civil rights, and so much more. ILNH will be using FT6’s approach in advance of the NJ governor's race. Field Team 6’s efforts are laser-focused on registering women, people of color, young people, LGBTQ+ and disabilities communities, veterans and faith communities and every good-hearted human we can find.",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

    "description": "There have been protests at the Tesla Store every Saturday since the middle of February.  Attendance has been outstanding in spite of some adverse weather conditions.  And support from passing motorists has been truly amazing.  \n\nBut Trump and Musk continue to destroy our democratic freedoms and carelessly dismantle our government institutions.  So let's turn up the heat with additional protests on weekdays!  Thursday through the lunch period appears to be the next most popular time other than Saturday.  Let's protest from 11:30 to 1:30 and see what kind of impact we have.  Consider it a test case and if the results are good, we will probably continue.\n\nRules & Reminders: Bring a sign. Stay on the sidewalk & allow pedestrians to pass. Do not jaywalk across Mayfield Road (police will be watching). Use the crosswalk just west of Tesla. Don't block driveway entrances or exits. Don't harass Tesla customers or employees. Do not argue with counter protesters. Do not use inflammatory language or make threats. Watch for peacekeepers in yellow vests and immediately report any disturbances to them. Follow any instructions from Lyndhurst Police. PROTEST PEACEFULLY.\n\nParking is available at Messiah Lutheran Church, 5200 Mayfield Road. Please be respectful and park on the EAST SIDE of the lot first (away from the Tesla Store). Additional parking is available at the Lyndhurst Community of Faith Church, 5312 Mayfield Road. Please enter the EAST DRIVEWAY as the west driveway is exit only.",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re holding a rally in St. Augustine. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\n\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

HB 220 has passed out of the House, but we need Chairmen Hughes to schedule it for a Senate State Affairs hearing ASAP! \n\nThis bill would require Texas health care facilities to provide access to emergency contraception if clinically indicated and consent given, a private space when available, and the option to shower after a forensic exam. These are basic, trauma-informed protections that support survivors in their healing process.\n\nCollege students and young people face a higher risk of sexual violence, yet many do not receive adequate care when they seek help. HB 220 takes a step toward ensuring all survivors in Texas are treated with the care and respect they deserve.\n\nChairmen Hughes needs to hear from you! Urge him to bring HB 220/SB 1899 for a hearing and demand better care for survivors.\n\n\nNote: Once you hit \"Send an Email\" you should get an email pop-up allowing you to customize your message before sending it to the Chairmen Hughes.

During this phonebank, we’ll contact voters who had a mail ballot in 2024 but haven’t yet re-enrolled—helping them take the steps to stay on track for future elections.\n\nWe’ll provide all the training, tools, and support you need. No experience necessary—just a willingness to make a difference.\nThis is how we strengthen our grassroots infrastructure and build momentum for the elections ahead.",

All are invited who feel the Trump Administration has created a constitutional crisis and the systematic dismantling of our governmental institutions, universities and way of life.  \n\n*It takes courage to come out in public and protest/exercise your I st Amendment Right.\n*If you choose to do so, you will not be alone. You will be with like minded people from your home community. No longer will your feelings be pent up inside and you will feel a sense of freedom.\n*By protesting you will let your community know that we are not ok with what's going on in Washington.\n*We need to be mindful that this is a State highway. Be careful. We need to be mindful that people park their cars and walk the sidewalks in the Maytown Square. Do not make an issue for these folks.\n*Bring your signs. Think about topics that unite all people-Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans, Department of Education, tariffs and the list goes on forever. We will have prizes for the following categories-funny, creative and artistic. Prizes awarded at end of event.\n*No obscenities. Be prepared to be confronted. Be prepared to have a finger directed your way. Smile and tell them to have a nice day. Defuse. If necessary, walk away.\n*Invite your friends, family members and anyone who you believe would have an interest in protesting. We don't have to drive to Lancaster, Harrisburg or Washington DC.",

    "description": "VENMO @SaveFWCC to contribute to our campaign\n\nFOLLOW on Instagram @SaveFWCC\n\nFor over a century, Fort Washington Collegiate Church has served the uptown community as more than just a house of worship. Ft. Washington is a beacon of light, a collective gathering point, and an anchor for numerous programs serving our Washington Heights and uptown community. The closure on June 30, 2025, will force Ft. Washington and the programs that call this place home to shutter their doors, leaving a massive void in our communal social fabric. \n\nFt. Washington is a symbol of unity and togetherness. It is a center for local music and the arts through the Fort Washington Community Choir, Washington Heights Chamber Orchestra, Up Theater, and Uptown Enclave. It embodies interfaith connection through the Fort Tryon Jewish Center, offers a sanctuary of nature and beauty through the Fort Washington Green, a center for recovery through AA, Al-Anon, and NA meetings, and nourishes families through the Fort Fridge.\n\nThe greater Collegiate Board’s recent decision to close Ft. Washington will rob our community of these essential programs, resources, and vital communal space. As friends and neighbors who benefit from and greatly appreciate Ft. Washington's contributions to our community, we seek your help. We implore the Collegiate Board to stop the proposed shutdown on June 30, 2025 and allow Ft. Washington and its community partners time to secure additional funding.\n\nThe closure of Ft. Washington’s campus represents the death of a piece of the heart of our uptown community. The fight to keep this beloved space open is a fight to keep our community whole. Please join this community led effort to urge the Consistory to stop the proposed closure of Ft. Washington Collegiate Church on June 30, 2025. \n\nSome of the groups who meet in this sacred space include:\nSupport and Recovery Groups\nFort Fridge\nFort Tryon Jewish Center\nFort Washington Collegiate Church\nFort Washington Community Choir\nFort Washington Green\nUptown Enclave\nUp Theater Company\nWashington Heights Chamber Orchestra\n\n_________________________\n\n\nDurante más de un siglo, la Iglesia Colegiada de Fort Washington ha servido a la comunidad del norte de Manhattan como algo más que un lugar de adoración. Fort Washington es un faro de luz, un punto de encuentro colectivo y un pilar para numerosos programas que sirven a nuestra comunidad de Washington Heights.Cerrando las puertas de Fort Washington el 30 de junio de 2025 dejará un enorme vacío en el tejido social de nuestra comunidad.\n\nFort Washington es un símbolo de unidad y solidaridad. Es un centro para la música local y las artes a través del Coro Comunitario de Fort Washington, la Orquesta de Cámara de Washington Heights, Up Theater y Uptown Enclave. Representa la conexión interreligiosa mediante el Centro Judío Fort Tryon, ofrece un santuario de naturaleza y belleza a través del Fort Washington Green, un centro de recuperación con los grupos de apoyo AA, Al-Anon, y NA, y nutre a las familias a través del Fort Fridge.\n\nLa reciente decisión del Consistorio de cerrar Fort Washington privará a nuestra comunidad de estos programas esenciales, recursos y espacio comunitario. Como amigos y vecinos que benefician y aprecian profundamente las contribuciones de Fort Washington a nuestra comunidad, solicitamos su ayuda. Imploramos al Consistorio que detenga el cierre propuesto para el 30 de junio de 2025 y permita que Fort Washington y sus socios comunitarios tengan tiempo para asegurar fondos adicionales.\n\nEl cierre del campus de Fort Washington representa la pérdida de una parte del corazón de nuestra comunidad del norte de Manhattan. La lucha por mantener este querido espacio abierto es una lucha por preservar la integridad de nuestra comunidad. Únase a este esfuerzo liderado por la comunidad para detener el cierre propuesto de la Iglesia Colegial Fort Washington el 30 de junio de 2025.\n\nRegístrese pare recibir actualizaciones o ser voluntario \n\nPara aprender más sobre Fort Washington y sus socios comunitarios:\n\nGrupos de Apoyo Mutuo\nFort Fridge\nFort Tryon Jewish Center\nFort Washington Collegiate Church\nFort Washington Community Choir\nFort Washington Green\nUptown Enclave\nUp Theater Company\nWashington Heights Chamber Orchestra\n\nReport a policy violation",

Insurance companies and for-profit middlemen create barriers to care and massive administrative waste. These result in unnecessary suffering and deaths. For over 60 years, piecemeal reforms have resulted in higher costs and the worst health outcomes among comparable nations. Please see their list of demands at: https://nationalsinglepayer.com/national-day-of-action/\n\nThe Trump Administration will cut nearly 80,000 employees from the VA in two phases; June 1st and September 1st.

We’ll walk through the digital tools we use: Spoke for peer-to-peer texting and Votivate for canvassing. \n\nWhether you’re new to this work or need a refresher, this is a great space to learn and connect with others committed to making a difference. We’ll also discuss our voter outreach plans for the next month and how you can plug in. All are welcome. Light refreshments will be served.",

I have never served or not a veteran.** \n\nJust like 47 failed Day 1 promises of lower gas prices, affordable housing and lower gas prices, he and his billionaire buddies are making way to break the promises America made to veterans. When the current administration attacks one, they attacks us all. About 1/3 of federal workers are also veterans and want to send a clear message to this current administration to defend the benefits, jobs and dignity which every generation of veterans has earned through sacrifice. **THEY ARE THE FEW! WE ARE THE MANY!**\n\n**THE PACT ACT IS UNDER ATTACK**\nThe **P** in **PACT** stands for **Promise**.  For this virtual event,  **P** stands for **Pledge**  for positive action to **resist** the status quo, **insist** on the rule of law, **persist** for democracy and **enlist** for the cause by attending or sharing this rally. **PLEDGE TO DO YOUR PART SO CONGRESS IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE AMERICAN PROMISE TO VETERANS!**\n\n**Pledge** to do anything or everything you can to support this rally. Veterans want to unite veterans and also all Americans as this fight is for all of us **against the criminality, cruelty and corruption** of 47 and his billionaire buddies.\n\n**NO KINGS! NOT EVER!**\n**We do not consent to this president.**\n**We are a PEOPLE POWERED MOVEMENT!**\n\n**We all have the power to be courageous. Let’s spread the word of courage, to reclaim our power!**",

Anyone who picks up is usually glad to hear from the Party. If nobody answers, leave a message. (Then, if you're comfortable, follow up with a text.)\n\n## WRITE THIS DOWN BEFORE YOU CALL.\nYou will urge Charlotte Dems to call the Supervisor of Elections (SOE) (941-833-5400) or update their VBM enrollment at the SOE website: https://www.soecharlottecountyfl.gov/Voter-Information/Vote-By-Mail.",

Spring migration is in full swing this month, and we're hosting a Spring Migration Walk through Brincka Cross Gardens led by JTNWI organizing director and avid birder, Lisa Vallee, with Kim Ehn, president of Dunes-Calumet Audubon. This free and family-friendly event offers a unique opportunity to observe various migratory birds, including warblers, thrushes, and sparrows. \n\nOur walk will explore key birding hotspots within the woods, offering tips on identification, birding by ear, and the importance of Indiana’s habitats for migratory species. \n\nWhether you're a first-timer or a seasoned birder, all are welcome! Binoculars and all outing supplies will be provided. Registration is required, and spots are limited, so please only register if you are sure to join!",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

The current administration is making a full-blown power grab — shredding the rule of law, ignoring the courts, and handing over control of our country’s financial system to a billionaire crony.

Here in Mahoning County, we draw the line. We demand justice. We demand a future that puts people before profit. We envision a future where healthcare is a right, not a privilege; where public education is for everyone; where billionaires don’t get to rewrite the rules to favor themselves and enslave the workers. \n\nThis is more than a protest – this is a movement to reclaim our power, restore our rights, and fight for a future where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.\n\n\nWhere: Mahoning County Courthouse, 120 Market Street, Youngstown Ohio 44503\n\nWhen 3:00PM-6:00PM\n\nSign up now and bring a friend!\n\nHow to Prepare for Your Event:\n\n- Bring chairs and your outside voices!\n- Brinq signs or props → Make your message visible!\n\n(Ideas: \"PROTECT OUR CONSTITUTION,\" \"NO KINGS\", \"PROTECT OUR MEDICAID\", “STOP THE COUP\", \"NO TAX BREAKS FOR\nBILLIONAIRES\")\n\nRecruit friends → The more people, the more power.\n\nRecord everything → Post photos/videos and tag us @MahoningValleyFreedomFighters #MVFF\n\nContact Us: Indivisiblefreedomfighters@gmail.com",

It is a living tapestry, crafted in defiance of the violence, greed, and cruelty that haunt our world, and stitched with the belief that a more just and compassionate future is always possible.

NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",

    "description": "Join us for our 10th consecutive rally to Defend Democracy in beautiful downtown Bethel.  While our overall theme is Defending Democracy, each week we pick a specific focus.  On Saturday May 10th 11am -12:30pm, our focus will be Woman's Rights.\n\nThe rally is non-partisian.  All are welcome.  We'll have speakers address the attack on Woman's Rights by threats to DEI, Voting rights and Healthcare.\nGuest speakers include a local ACLU lawyer involved in the reproductive rights movement and a local community member who would like to share their story and experience on why women’s healthcare needs to be equally accessible for everyone in this country.  Our live music will be provided by Sweet Polly Duo, a great duo from Clinton, CT.  They are an energetic pairing of vocals by Pat Anwari and guitar by Rocky Ridge.\n\nThere will be something for everyone.  We'll have speakers, we'll rally with our signs, we'll take a short march and we'll have live music.  We also like to end each week with a sing-a-long.\n\nA sign-making table will also be available,  complete with all the necessary supplies,  for young and old to make signs for the rally.\n\nWe also collect a non-perishable food item for our local food pantry each week.",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

But real power isn’t staged in Washington. It rises up everywhere else.\n\nNo Kings is a nationwide day of defiance. From city blocks to small towns, from courthouse steps to community parks, we’re taking action to reject authoritarianism—and show the world what democracy really looks like.\n\nWe’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.",

NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\nWe’re telling the world that we’ll have NO KINGS in this country. We’re celebrating Flag Day as it should be celebrated, with Old Glory, a parade, lots of fun, and a big fat NO KINGS to Donald Trump. Bring your signs, bring your flags, and bring it on!\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",

On Saturday, May 17, we will raise our voices against attacks launched by the Trump administration.\n\n## We're Fighting Back!\n\nWe won’t stand by while the attacks from the Trump administration threaten resources for our students. Our union has the power to demand that Congress protect funding for students and the Department of Education programs we all rely on, and to keep our school spaces safe from ICE Raids.\n\nOn Saturday, May 17, join educators and allies at Fight for Schools rallies across our state to stand up for students and defend public education!\n\n## How We Are Fighting Back\n\nOur Union is Organizing Mass Rallies on May 17\n\nWe launched an initiative with members, local chapter leaders, and both CTA and NEA Board of Directors and organized delegations to the 9 GOP Congressional member offices in California from April 11 to April 27, when representatives were in their districts. We urged members of Congress to commit to protecting funding for students and the Department of Education programs we all rely on, and to keep our school spaces safe for all students!\n\nAdditionally, we’ll be organizing with local chapters in Sacramento, San Francisco, Hanford, Los Angeles, and San Diego for rallies on May 17.

    "description": "Hey Indivisible Westside and Friends! \n\nJoin tens of thousands of your fellow Chicago-area citizens as we form a human chain of conscience across Chicagoland in peaceful protest against Trump’s illegal and authoritarian actions and the GOP's failure to defend the Constitution.\n\nBring signs, wear black, and make some noise.\n\nWe will line sidewalks along 30 miles from Aurora to Chicago along Ogden Ave, 26th Street and California Ave to Douglass Park. This is a peaceful protest. We will not block streets or businesses along the route.\n\nPlease go to www.handsacrosschi.com and enter your zip code to get an assigned location along the route (No need to RSVP - use the \"Find Your Spot\" button). This is important so that we can spread people out evenly along the route, while keeping people closer to where they live. Our assigned geographical area is roughly the stretch of Ogden from 1st Ave to Cicero based on our zip codes for Indivisible Westside.\n\n{{Ignore the map below; that is not your assigned location}}\n\nPresident Trump has defied court orders and forcibly sent people to a torture dungeon in El Salvador without a hearing or due process. Now he claims he’s unable to bring them back. He's ignored court rulings and arrested judges. If he can do this to them, he can do it to anyone.\n\nThese are the actions of a dictator—not a democratically elected president. Silence is not an option. When leaders cross the line into authoritarianism, it’s up to us—the people—to push back. This protest is about more than politics.

However, state funding shortfalls have forced our agency to promise drastic cuts that would decimate our city. The good news is that riders are fighting back. Just last week, hundreds of PGH transit supporters rallied for expanded service. We've released a policy roadmap that can expand our service and some of our legislators are putting these ideas into action. The time is now to keep the pressure on and we need you in this fight!\n\nAll are welcome to join PPT for our Monthly General Meeting. We use our meeting each month to give updates on current campaigns, discuss strategy and tactics, train on new skills and build community. This month's meeting will be on Zoom. Feel free to join this virtual meeting, 6:30pm Social time // 7:00-8:30pm Meeting.\n\n--------------\n\n## ¡Nuestro servicio de transporte local necesita financiación estatal! // 13 de mayo // 6:30 p. m. - Hora de convivencia // 7-8:30 p. m. - Reunión // Habrá interpretación en español y ASL disponible.\n\nSeamos negros o blancos, ricos o pobres, los habitantes de Pittsburgh necesitamos un sistema de transporte público ampliado en el que podamos confiar. Sin embargo, la escasez de fondos estatales ha obligado a nuestra agencia a prometer recortes drásticos que devastarían nuestra ciudad. La buena noticia es que los usuarios están contraatacando. La semana pasada, cientos de partidarios del transporte público de PGH se manifestaron para ampliar el servicio. Hemos publicado una hoja de ruta de políticas que puede ampliar nuestro servicio y algunos de nuestros legisladores están poniendo estas ideas en práctica. ¡Es hora de mantener la presión y los necesitamos en esta lucha!\n\nTodos son bienvenidos a unirse a PPT para nuestra Asamblea General Mensual.

Join us and help make this impactful by emailing egormley@citizenactionny.org.\n\nThe climate change-denier in the White House is doing everything he can to eliminate climate progress in this country. We need climate leadership in NY, and we need it now. Unfortunately, in January, Governor Hochul revealed that she’s delaying a crucial component of the state’s Climate Law called Cap and Invest. \n\n\nCap and Invest is an emissions-reduction program that would limit, or cap, emissions from major polluters in the state. That cap would tighten over time, gradually reducing the amount of emissions allowed for release. Meanwhile, major polluters will have to pay to release polluting emissions up to the level of the cap. Those funds from polluters will then be used to invest in green energy, jobs, home decarbonization programs, and similar efforts to support NY communities.\n\nTo move Cap and Invest forward, we need the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) to release three sets of regulations that hold polluters accountable to Cap and Invest. Unfortunately, Governor Hochul has  released only one.",

    "description": "Join us at 7th Street Park in Hudson between 11:00 AM and 3:00 PM to help collect signatures for the 2025 referendum to establish a full-time, elected County Executive. We’ll be handing out petition packets and turf assignments—just stop by, pick up materials, and head out to help us reach voters across Columbia County. Every signature brings us one step closer to getting this critical question on the ballot. Whether you can give an hour or all afternoon, we’d love to have you. Let’s get this done—together.",
