We're DOUBLING DOWN!**\n\nOur protests have helped force Musk from DC but our work is far from done. **Tesla's stock is UP because investors think we're going to fade away** while Musk buys our elections, spews hate and lies on his social network, and bullies even conservative members of Congress into giving Trump the power of a KING.\n\nThe stakes couldn’t be higher. No one is coming to save us. Not politicians, not the media, not the courts. **Our democracy has never faced someone with so much money and so little shame as Elon Musk.**\n\nPlease, join us. We need your voice. Let's make some noise!\n\nSee you Saturday! \nPS. For our full schedule, check out DefundMusk.com.\n\nTesla Takedown is a peaceful protest movement. We oppose violence, vandalism and destruction of property. Please treat Tesla drivers with respect as they are most likely on our side!\n\n#TeslaTakedown #BoycottTesla #DefundMusk",

With immigration enforcement engaging in human rights abuses and communities under attack, now more than ever do we need to come together because WE protect US. In this training we’ll ground ourselves in the principles and opportunities of mutual aid as a political act; we’ll go over Know Your Rights basics; and how to create communities of safety in plain sight including taking stock of community resources like bail funds and how to use privilege to protect more vulnerable community members in our everyday lives.\n\nLearn more about Moms Next Door and sign up for the monthly Dispatch, where we will share information, education, and resources to workshop how we will create change together, at https://www.momsrising.org/MomsNextDoorDispatch",

    "description": "This a local Indivisible event! We will be meeting in a small park in downtown Brockport to host a community outreach event. According to Jason Stanley (Erasing History) Democracy requires a common understanding of reality, a shared view of what has happened, that informs ordinary citizens' view about what should happen, now and in the future. Authoritarians target this shared understanding, seeking to separate us from our own history to destroy our self-understanding. By setting us against each other, authoritarians present themselves as the sole solution. This event is in response to the erasing of history, data and information by the current regime. Come share and discuss things that are disappearing, such as health, climate and demographic data, historical facts and people, and books and research on women, LGTQIA+, or people of color.",

Across the country, we will take to the streets and into communities to uplift his non-violent struggle for justice, voting rights, and dignity for all.\n\nThis is more than a protest—this is a moral reckoning; this is a fight against voter suppression; this is the new front in the freedom struggle; this is a continuation of Congressman Lewis’ legacy; this is a movement for Democracy!",

In order to BLOCK Andrew Cuomo and elect a mayor who will prioritize the needs of working families above the demands of the rich and well-connected we need ALL HANDS ON DECK! \n\nFrom June 14th-June 24th we need to talk to thousands of voters and that means covering dozens of poll sites across the city. We need YOU to be a poll site captain and support volunteers in getting out the vote! \n\nJoin us for a training where you'll learn everything you need to know to captain a poll site and train volunteers to talk to voters! No experience necessary - we'll cover everything from start to finish.\n\n-\n\nWhat is ‘Rank the Slate’? It means you vote by ranking ALL the Working Families candidates—1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd, and so on—so your preferences help decide the winner, not just your top pick. With multiple progressive candidates running, the NY WFP is taking on the challenge of keeping progressives united, asking voters to rank ALL candidates on the Working Families Slate —> Adrienne Adams, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani and Zellnor Myrie <— to make sure that a Working Families champion is the next mayor of New York City.\n\nBecause we need candidates for EVERY office fighting for working people, we’re also encouraging voters to vote for Justin Brannan for Comptroller and Jumaane WIlliams for Public Advocate—two progressive champions who are committed to fighting for working families.",

We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies.\n\nOn June 14th Marin County says No Thrones! No Crowns! No Kings! Local citizen action groups are working together to organize a coordinated, county-wide day of NO KINGS action against the Trump regime.\n\nEvents will pop up at the same time highly visible locations throughout Marin. Together and all at once, we will show our strength in numbers, build our movement, and send a loud and clear message that Marin stands together against rising authoritarianism and a wannabe King.\n\nMore Marin events will be added in coming days and weeks. Sign up to attend the action for this location or check back soon to find additional locations.\n\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. All participants agree to assume 100% responsibility for their own safety, conduct and well-being.\n\nThis event is being sponsored by Indivisible West Marin.",

Join us virtually to make phone calls to voters every weekday from 6:00pm-8:00pm.\n\nAbout Daniel: As the first in his family to go to college, Daniel attended the University of Arizona where he interned for then-Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Daniel was a survivor of the 2011 Tucson shooting and was the first to administer first aid before EMTs arrived on the scene. Turning tragedy into resilience, Daniel decided to live a life of public service to protect Arizonan families and served on the Sunnyside School board (2011-2015) and was later elected to the Arizona State Legislature (2017-2022). Now, Daniel is running for Congress to Fight the Trump Administration to protect Arizonans' social security and healthcare access, expand federal dollars into public education, and lower the cost of everyday goods and housing.",

Daniel was a survivor of the 2011 Tucson shooting and was the first to administer first aid before EMTs arrived on the scene. Turning tragedy into resilience, Daniel decided to live a life of public service to protect Arizonan families and served on the Sunnyside School board (2011-2015) and was later elected to the Arizona State Legislature (2017-2022). Now, Daniel is running for Congress to Fight the Trump Administration to protect Arizonans' social security and healthcare access, expand federal dollars into public education, and lower the cost of everyday goods and housing.",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\r\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\r\n\r\n\r\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\r\n\r\n\r\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\r\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\r\n\r\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Join us for a rally and press conference where we will be calling out Former Gov. Cuomo for his awful record on climate and environmental justice. We'll be joined by a vast swath of climate, environmental justice, and environmental groups, activists, and elected leaders (many of whom, the very leaders who won the fracking ban, the CLCPA, and climate legislation during his tenure). \n\nDespite holding the office of Governor during some of our movement's biggest wins on climate, Andrew Cuomo fought us at every turn. His record at large remains one of fossil fuel allyship and climate delay. From leading an effort to overturn our city-level Green New Deal for Buildings (LL97) in 2020 to weakening and slowing implementation of our climate laws, from taking endless sums of fossil fuel money to approving fossil fuel project after project, and from defunding the MTA and clean water funds in favor of pet-projects and tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy, Cuomo represents a throwback to fossil fuel-funded leadership. We need other leaders for our future, people who work for us.\n\nOur climate's future is on the line.\n\nWe will be offering an F grade to Former Governor Andrew Cuomo on his record, pointing to his opponents as alternatives, and reminding all that “Cuomo is a Climate Disaster.”\n\n----\nFollowing the main event, the New York Working Families Party will independently host a #DontRankCuomo & #RankTheSlate canvass to talk to local voters about the former Governor's record and the options for our city's future.",

    "description": "# Thank Senator Yundt for Standing Up for Public Education\n\n**Senator Robert Yundt** played a pivotal role in bringing *HB 57*, the bipartisan education bill, to the floor of the Alaska Senate. He helped broker agreements between the Senate Majority and Minority caucuses — and when it counted most, he voted to **override Governor Dunleavy’s veto**.\n\nHe was the **only Senator from the Mat-Su** to vote for the override.\n\nSenator Yundt’s leadership helped protect funding for Alaska’s students, educators, and schools. But we know the fight isn’t over — if the governor tries to use **line-item vetoes** to gut education funding, we’ll need Senator Yundt’s support again.\n\n**Let’s thank him — and remind him we’re counting on his continued leadership.**\nIf you would rather email him (not as effective) here is his email address: **Email:** [Senator.Robert.Yundt@akleg.gov](mailto:Senator.Robert.Yundt@akleg.gov)\n\n---\n\nHere is a draft script to modify.\n\n> Hello, my name is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and I live in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.  \n>  \n> I’m calling to **thank Senator Yundt** for his leadership on HB 57 and for voting to override Governor Dunleavy’s veto. I truly appreciate that he was willing to work across the aisle and stand up for our public schools — and that he was the only Senator from the Mat-Su to do so.  \n>  \n> I hope Senator Yundt will continue to support education by **overriding any future line-item vetoes** that would reduce funding for Alaska’s schools.  \n>  \n> Please let him know that his leadership made a real difference and that his constituents are paying attention.  \n>  \n> Thank you.",

Pennsylvania is a must-win state! These postcards will remind likely blue voters to vote. \n\n***We ask that you write then STOCKPILE these postcards and mail them this October. DO NOT MAIL THEM PRIOR. Thank you.***\n\n\n**IMPORTANT DETAILS:**\n\n1. Pick up your cards on *ANYTIME between 11am and 7pm*. \n\n2.

    "description": "Indivisible Whidbey and League of Women Voters are bringing you NO KINGS WHIDBEY\n\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\nOn Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide.\n\nHere on Whidbey, we will gather in **Coupeville** at the overpass intersection of Main St and Highway 20. We will be rallying from 10-11:45 so that afterwards, we can all join **Coupeville Pride** at noon. We are celebrating **JOY** and **leaving hate behind.**\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

Roughly 6,000 Veterans have lost their jobs due to DOGE cuts to the federal workforce. More than 2,400 staffers have been fired from the VA, with DOGE planning to cut 80,000 more jobs from the VA. DOGE directed the VA to cancel over 800 contracts that support everything from chemotherapy treatment to records digitization. Thousands of Veterans are also now at risk of losing their homes due to the ending of the VA's mortgage-rescue VASP program. In addition to all that, Trump has also implemented a transgender military ban, which will end the careers of many dedicated and experienced service members. These cuts impact the quality and timeliness of the services and benefits that our Veterans earned and deserve. \n\nThis is a peaceful rally; do not engage with anyone displaying hostile or disrespectful behavior. We are here to support our Veterans who deserve our best behavior.",

Daniel was a survivor of the 2011 Tucson shooting and was the first to administer first aid before EMTs arrived on the scene. Turning tragedy into resilience, Daniel decided to live a life of public service to protect Arizonan families and served on the Sunnyside School board (2011-2015) and was later elected to the Arizona State Legislature (2017-2022). Now, Daniel is running for Congress to Fight the Trump Administration to protect Arizonans' social security and healthcare access, expand federal dollars into public education, and lower the cost of everyday goods and housing.",

    "description": "Our Minnetonka Wednesday Weekly Protest event is a peaceful, legal, nonviolent, family-friendly expression of first amendment rights. We will gather on the public sidewalks and grassy banks along the road margins at the intersection of Minnesota State Highway 7 and County Road 101 in Minnetonka where we will display our hand-made signs in view of evening rush hour traffic at a busy intersection. The convener is experienced in protesting at this location in all kinds of weather. The Highway 7 corridor includes communities with some of the highest voter turnout and civic engagement in the entire country. Residents here span the whole political spectrum of the United States of America, but we all agree that there are no kings in America. In between elections, we remind elected officials that no one is above the law and every elected official is accountable to the people under the Constitution. We affirm that American values of democracy, freedom, and rule of law and opposition to Trump's unaffordable policies are broadly supported in our community. \n\nThe Wednesday 28 May 2025 event is the fourth in a planned long series of Minnetonka Wednesday Weekly Protest events that will continue indefinitely on each Wednesday afternoon through summer, autumn, winter, and into next year as needed until further notice.",

    "description": "Dear Mothers community,\n\nWe’re proud to join forces with a powerful coalition of Texas organizers and national allies — including Mothers Against Greg Abbott, Mothers for Democracy, Rep. Ron Reynolds, and Turn Left PAC — to launch The People vs Greg Abbott, a major Day of Action in Austin on Saturday, May 31st.\n\nThis rally is about more than Texas. It’s about showing that the people of Texas won’t stay silent while our rights are taken away — and we’re making sure the whole country pays attention. The extreme and harmful laws pushed by Governor Abbott and his MAGA allies are a trial run for the kinds of policies Donald Trump wants to force on the entire nation.\n\nWe’re fighting back against:\n🔥 Silencing voters in majority-Black and Latino communities\n 🔥 Criminalizing trans kids and targeting loving parents\n 🔥 Banning abortion with bounty-hunting tactics\n 🔥 Militarizing the border with razor wire and deadly barriers\n 🔥 Censoring educators and banning books\n 🔥 Raising power bills to enrich oil and gas donors\n 🔥 Neglecting infrastructure, leaving cities in constant boil-water crisis\n\n\n📍 On May 31st at 10AM, we’ll gather at the Texas Governor’s Mansion and march to the Capitol in a loud, visible rejection of extremism.\nHere’s how you can plug in — wherever you are:\n👉 Share this rally sign-up with friends, organizers, and networks in Texas\n 👉 Send this to local orgs and community leaders who should be part of the action\n 👉 Donate now to cover critical rally costs — permits, water, media, sound, signage, and more\n\nJoin the weekly call for groups and volunteers: https://www.mobilize.us/turnleftpac/event/788791/\n\nThis is our moment to show that the people — not political bullies — have the final word. Let’s make it impossible to ignore.\n\nIn solidarity,\nNancy Thompson\nMothers Against Greg Abbott",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies. They think they rule—but we are bigger than even their worst aspirations.\n\nDonald Trump is planning a military parade in Washington, D.C. on June 14. This display of might is intended to intimidate opponents and solidify his image as a strongman on our dime—we won’t stand by while that happens.\n\nInstead of allowing this military parade to be the center of gravity, we will make action everywhere else the story of America that day: people coming together in communities across the country to reject strongman politics and corruption.\n\nAlongside local organizers, partners, and leaders from across the pro-democracy & pro-worker movement, we will demonstrate organized people power that outpaces any authoritarian aspirations.",

    "description": "# ✊ DESFINANCIAR A LA OLIGARQUÍA · BENDICIÓN DE LA LIBERTAD · INDIVISIBLES ✊\n[in English](https://mobilize.us/s/3PHiaS)\n\n### Demostración Pública No Partidista — Sábado, 31 de mayo de 2025\n#### Lakeland, Florida\n\n# 📢 ESTO NO ES TU TÍPICO EVENTO DE LIBERTAD DE EXPRESIÓN\n#### Asegúrate de leer todas las instrucciones\n\nNos estamos levantando contra el contrato de 150 millones de dólares entre Avelo Airlines y ICE (la agencia de migración de EE.UU.) para operar vuelos de deportación. Estos vuelos están facilitando la expulsión de personas sin el debido proceso legal — lo que va en contra de los principios fundamentales de la república.\n\nEste es un llamado urgente a la acción. Nos estamos organizando para exigir que Avelo cancele su contrato con ICE y deje de participar en deportaciones inconstitucionales.\n\n# 🛑 ¿POR QUÉ PROTESTAMOS?\n\n❌ Avelo está colaborando con detenciones ilegales y deportaciones sin audiencia legal.\n\n❌ Ciudadanos estadounidenses y personas con permisos de trabajo — como Juan Carlos López-Gómez y Heidy Sánchez Tejeda — han sido detenidos sin justificación.\n\n❌ Hay niños que están siendo separados de sus padres, sin acceso a abogados, e incluso deportados mientras todavía están en medio de procesos legales por custodia — como el caso de una niña ciudadana estadounidense de dos años conocida como V.M.L.\n\n❌ Se están violando nuestros derechos constitucionales: el debido proceso, el derecho a defensa legal, y la protección frente a abusos del poder ejecutivo.\n\n# ✨ NOSOTROS DEFENDEMOS:\n\n- A las familias\n- Los derechos de las personas migrantes\n- El debido proceso\n- Las libertades constitucionales para todxs\n- La responsabilidad de las empresas que lucran con el sufrimiento humano\n\n# 🗓️ DETALLES DEL EVENTO\n\n📍 Lakeland, FL (la ubicación exacta se enviará por correo después del registro)\n\n🕒 Sábado, 31 de mayo de 2025, de 5:00 p. m. a 7:00 p. m.\n\n🎨 Habrá carteles disponibles (pero puedes traer el tuyo, sobre todo si destaca casos de personas detenidas o deportadas de forma injusta)\n\n🎭 Bienvenidos los disfraces, los instrumentos y los niños\n\n🌞 Vístete de acuerdo al clima. Trae bloqueador solar, gafas de sol y usa mascarilla si deseas mantener privacidad\n\n🚶‍♀️ Caminata corta (aproximadamente 320 metros) por veredas accesibles\n\n📢 No habrá cánticos ni megáfonos — vamos a cantar y dejar que los carteles hablen por nosotros\n\n🚻 Habrá baños públicos disponibles cerca\n\n🚗 No estaciones en el aeropuerto\n\n# 💡 RECOMENDACIONES\n\n👍 Nuestro compromiso es con la no violencia. Este será un acto pacífico. Sé respetuoso en todo momento.\n\n👍 Mantente alerta: pueden aparecer infiltrados o medios falsos haciéndose pasar por prensa independiente. Verifica antes de dar entrevistas.\n\n👍 No entres en discusiones con provocadores. Algunos se hacen pasar por manifestantes.\n\n👍 Enfócate en crear unidad y en defender nuestra república democrática y constitucional.\n\n# 🎶 CANTEMOS POR LA LIBERTAD — Te recomendamos practicar estas canciones:\n\n[This Land is Your Land](https://youtu.be/2Q7PULELvok?si=2ZBVKeoM5Ker0Zad)\n\n[My Country ’Tis of Thee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnH_OIgNgSY)\n\n[America the Beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWJF1yE3Y1E)\n\n[Star Spangled Banner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF01L85TYaw)\n\n# 🔗 CONFIRMA TU ASISTENCIA Y OBTÉN MÁS INFORMACIÓN\n\n✅ Confirmar tu asistencia en Mobilize es opcional\n\n🌐 También publicaremos la información del evento en: www.blessedbyliberty.org\n\n📄 Para más información sobre el contrato entre Avelo y ICE: www.stopavelo.org\n\nNos mantenemos firmes — y unidos, vamos a vencer.\n\n#DesfinanciarLaOligarquía #DebidoProcesoParaTodxs #AltoAvelo #BendiciónDeLaLibertad #IndivisibleLakeland #Indivisible #DefiendeLaConstitución #ContraTodosLosEnemigos\n\n\n*Un principio fundamental en todos los eventos de Indivisible es el compromiso con la acción no violenta. Esperamos que todas las personas participantes busquen reducir cualquier posible confrontación con quienes no compartan nuestros valores..*",

    "description": "On June 10th at 6 PM, we'll be coming together to save democracy by writing postcards to voters in Virginia to get out the vote in the November election. We will provide the postcards, the addresses, and the script.  You provide the stamps for the postcards you write or donate!  \n\nWhy write postcards to Virginia? \n\nVoters in Virginia will head to the polls this November to pick a new governor. Former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, and Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a MAGA Republican, are the candidates.\n\nThis is a state race, but one with national implications.\n(1)The Commonwealth is a national bellwether. It is here where positions, comms, and policy can, and will, be tested and impact the 2026 midterms. \n (2) Held in the odd year after the presidential election since 1869, Virginia’s gubernatorial race is a cyclical scorecard for voters’ moods and the issues at the forefront of the national consciousness. This enables learning and adjustments for '26   \n(3)  A Spanberger win will lessen the MAGA hold on Governorships, which is crucial to change MAGA policies at the state level \n(4) A Republican win in Virginia might be seen as a major embrace of Trump and Trumpism, even if it gets decided on other grounds. \n(5) Down-ballot races matter. While the governor’s race is always the marquee race, Virginia will also be electing all 100 members of the House of Delegates, where Democrats hold the narrowest of margins, 51-49.\n\nSo, come join us at Beermiscuous to write postcards to VA voters. Remember to bring postcard stamps!.\n\nLet's do this!",

On June 14, Trump plans to host a military parade on the 250th anniversary of the Army's founding, as well as his birthday. This is his second attempt to plan one, after a failed attempt for Veterans Day of 2018.\n\nIf Trump wants a birthday party, let's give him one to remember.\n\nCome join us at the Michigan State Capitol Building as we stand up for democracy and oppose the Trump Administration's attacks on the rights and livelihoods of Michiganders, Americans, and vulnerable people around the world. We will protest, hear fiery speeches, have 1-on-1 conversations with politicians, march in solidarity with a parade in front, and throw a carnival to highlight the absurdity of the military parade Trump has planned on his birthday.\n\nWe are planning to have food trucks, games, street performers, and other activities in the theme of a carnival.

    "description": "On June 14—Flag Day—Donald Trump wants tanks in the street and a made-for-TV display of dominance for his birthday. A spectacle meant to look like strength. No Kings is a nationwide day of defiance. From city blocks to small towns, from courthouse steps to community parks, we’re taking action to reject authoritarianism—and show the world what democracy really looks like. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind. On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. In cooperation with Organizations throughout South Florida including Palm Beach Indivisibles, Boca Resist and 50501, we are creating a large-scale event to overshadow Trump's birthday celebration and multi-million dollar military parade. This event will take place throughout Palm Beach County and will include a Car-A-Van action that will include an opportunity to make our voices heard as close as possible to Mar-A-Lago. The caravan from north Palm Beach County will merge with ours from the southern portion of the county before making our way towards Mar-A-Lago. From Mar-A-Lago, there will be a rally at Meyer Amphitheatre with speakers and music and hosted by Josh Weil. We need your participation to make a HUGE impact. Decorate your car, bring your signs and join this movement! From south Palm Beach County, you can join the caravan at several different points. The exact times and locations will be sent out closer to the event. Wherever you choose to join the caravan is completely up to you. We are hoping for a massive turnout making our presence known not just in Florida but nationally.",

This is a cruel, inhumane, and illegal partnership, and we’re coming together across the country to stop it.\n\nOn Saturday, May 31st, we’re joining forces with STOPAVELO.ORG National to protest in cities across the U.S. This is a call to action for anyone who believes in democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.\n\nTogether, we will:\n\nProtest at Avelo-serviced airports nationwide\n\nBoycott Avelo Airlines and push ticket sales to zero\n\nDemand city and state officials cancel all Avelo contracts and subsidies\n\nShine a spotlight on this airline’s shameful role in aiding unlawful deportations\n\nJoin us at the airport protest. Your voice counts — and it’s needed now more than ever.\n\nLet’s stand together against fascism, family separation, and corporate complicity.\nNo more silence. No more flights. #StopAvelo\n\n#PeopleOverProfit #NoICEFlights #DueProcessForAll #IndivisibleCA27\n#StopAvelo\n\n\n*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

From his failure to fight for meaningful relief after Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina, to his continued support of an incompetent Secretary of Defense, Senator Thom Tillis has let our state down.\n\n**It's time to remind our neighbors just how much is at stake — and to demand better.**\n\nJoin us for a grassroots canvassing effort to hold Senator Tillis accountable and help elect leaders who put North Carolina first. We'll provide training, materials, and support — no experience needed, just your passion for change.\n\n**Let’s talk to voters. Let’s speak the truth. Let’s fight back.**",

    "description": "This a local event by Indivisible Jefferson County WV\n\nUNITE FOR VETERANS\n\nAmerica made a promise to its veterans. It's a promise we intend to keep.\nOn June 6th, join thousands of veterans, military families, and their allies on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., for the Unite for Veterans, Unite for America Rally.\nWe are coming together to defend the benefits, jobs, and dignity that every generation of veterans has earned through sacrifice.\nVeteran jobs, healthcare, and essential VA services are under attack. We will not stand by.\n________________________________________\nRally Details\nWhen: Friday, June 6th, 2025\nTime: 11:30 a.m. until 1 p.m.\nWhere: The old Jefferson County Courthouse located at 100 E Washington Street\n________________________________________\nWhy We Rally\nVeterans and military family members are being fired by the thousands from federal jobs. Veterans’ healthcare is being gutted and their benefits are under siege.\nThis isn't the first time veterans have had to fight for what was promised. From the Bonus Army of 1932 to the battles for the GI Bill and Agent Orange care, veterans have always led the charge for justice.\nNow, it's our turn.\nWe rally to:\nDefend veteran and military family member employment in the federal workforce\nStop the privatization and weakening of the Department of Veterans Affairs\nHold political leaders accountable for policies that harm veterans and their families\n_______________________________________\nThe Unite for Veterans, Unite for America rally, is scheduled for the 81st anniversary of D-Day, aims to be a nonpartisan call to preserve veterans' jobs and benefits and promote the protection of democratic principles. On June 6, we rally and stand united for our veterans and we fight for their benefits, care, and dignity.\n\nVeterans sacrificed their lives and time with their families to keep us safe. When our armed forces showed up on the beaches of Normandy, they were showing up to protect the freedom of so many (both American and European alike). Now it’s time for us to protect them.\nThe Trump regime has been slowly dismantling Vet services. Veteran jobs, healthcare, and essential VA services are under attack. On D-Day, join us in support of our local vets by waving signs in our community.\n\nA core principle behind all Indivisible Jefferson County WV is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.\n\nA parking map of Charles Town WV is below. We are wanting to be good neighbors, therefore please avoid parking downtown Charles Town in front of businesses.\nfile:///C:/Users/spipe/Downloads/CTPD%202025%20Parking%20Brochure%20(1).pdf\nWe are working with Charles Town Presbyterian Church and they have graciously offered for us to use their parking lot. \nThere is handicapped parking available near our location. \n\nWe ask, when possible, to stop by the local businesses to support them. Have a cup of coffee. Pick up a bottle of wine. Grab a bite to eat. Downtown has much to offer.\n\nBring water! Stay hydrated. We appreciate water donations. You can drop off water donations or snacks with the Care Marshal who will be set up in front of the Jefferson Court House.\nAll Marshals will be wearing safety vests in yellow or orange.\n\nThe message should be loud and clear – it is all about our Veterans!\nWe stand united.\nBring signs or props → Make your message visible! Bring signs and banners, and emphasize our message!\n\nUNITED WE STAND WITH OUR VETERANS\nStop VA Job Cuts\nProtect our Veterans\nProtect Civil Servants\nPreserve veterans' jobs and benefits\nSupport Veterans\nThank you Veterans\nHANDS OFF VETERANS BENEFITS\nProtect Veterans\nProtect our VA\nProtect all who served\nProtect Veterans Benefits\nNO privatizing of the VA\nWe  honor all who served\n\nTake pictures of your signs and email them to indivisible@indivisiblejeffersoncounty.org and we will post them on social media.\nTag your social media posts #IJCWV #uniteforveterans\n  Recruit friends → The more people, the more power.\n  Record everything → Post photos/videos with #UNITEFORVETERANS #IJCWV\nWe’re fighting for our democracy!\n\nNot everyone can join an action on the street, but everyone can do something!\nOn June 6th, and leading up to June 6th and call your representatives. Tell them it is NOT okay to slash Veteran benefits. It is NOT okay for them to fire federal works in the VA. We need to protect our Veterans and it is their job to do so!\nSend a post card. Email them. Have a post card or phone bank party!\n\n\nOther notes from the organizers:\n\nIndivisible Jefferson County WV are powered by you. This allows us to keep showing up, organizing, and creating safe, welcoming spaces for us \nall. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/indivisiblejc1326431646\n\n\n*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

For three weeks, we'll be taking samples specifically looking at bacteria pollution in Mud Creek. \n\nWe'll meet at the Ingles parking lot (address below), where MountainTrue staff will give you materials and teach you what you need to know. From there, we'll all go grab samples from different locations and then meet back at the Ingles parking lot by 2PM to drop samples off, so MountainTrue staff can bring them back to the lab to process. \n\nBring lunch and a small cooler if you have one. We'll provide sampling materials and gloves. We'll be working off of Google Maps, so it's helpful to have that app on your phone, or partner with someone who does. Wear clothes and shoes you don't mind getting wet or dirty.\n\nMeet-up location: We will meet at Tunnel Rd. Ingles (1980 Asheville Hwy, Hendersonville, NC 28791\n\n\nPhoto Release & Waiver of Liability: all participants must read and agree:\nThere are certain risks inherent in any outdoor activity. Each participant, member, and guest must check the box below and in doing so, agrees to release from liability the leader(s), MountainTrue, its Partners, Affiliates, and members for any accident, injury, illness, or personal loss which might occur while participating in this activity or while traveling in any vehicle during this trip.

Help remind folks that they, too, can stand up for their beliefs - and that there's lots and lots of people who aren't on board with the \"cruelty as entertainment\" behavior of Trump and Musk and the GOP.\n\n### Recent DOT Visits\n\nA Department of Transportation employee has visited twice in the past three weeks to ask that people NOT attach anything to the fencing. On 5/20, he parked and waited until everything was removed from the fencing. It seems reasonable to expect that DOT enforcement will continue.\n\n### How to Get There\n\nThe address \"9 Mountain Park Rd, Holyoke\" will get you there if you're using Waze. (Mountain Park Road runs off Route 5, and is not accessible from I-91.) People have reported that some GPS systems bring you right under the bridge, but on I-91. That’s annoying!\n\nPlease park on the side of the road before the bridge. We can't park on the bridge.\n\n### Other Stuff\n\nPlease take everything you brought away with you, and leave the site totally clean.\n\nIf rain is predicted, we'll cancel. If we cancel, you'll receive an email notification.\n\nWe may see a counter protester. If so, the best thing to do is just ignore them and spend our time and energy waving to motorists. Let's keep things 100% non-confrontational in words and body language.\n\n### A Few Requests\n\nWe've found that roof rake sections make wonderful flagpoles and banner poles. If you have a roof rake (or 10’-15’ light metal poles or conduit) to contribute, we'll be happy to take it off your hands!\n\nDonations...we've purchased banners and grommets and flags and zip ties and bungee cords, and we'll be getting more. We’ve purchased 20” x 30” letter boards for messaging we can change. All this costs $$$. We'll have a bucket for donations, and if you could throw something in, that'd be great.

Be it disability insurance, medicare and medicaid, SNAP, housing funds, or funds for education - we know that our neighbors who have served will suffer, as will our queer, black, brown, indigenous siblings, and all other Kentuckians from this bill. \n\nThey ask that signs focus exclusively on the impact of our veterans as we commemorate the fight against fascism, and they will have national actions folks can link to, specifically supporting continued funding for the VA.",

For three weeks, we'll be taking samples specifically looking at bacteria pollution in Hominy Creek. \n\nWe'll meet at the Ingles parking lot (address below), where MountainTrue staff will give you materials and teach you what you need to know. From there, we'll all go grab samples from different locations and then meet back at the Ingles parking lot by 2PM to drop samples off, so MountainTrue staff can bring them back to the lab to process. \n\nBring lunch and a small cooler if you have one. We'll provide sampling materials and gloves. We'll be working off of Google Maps, so it's helpful to have that app on your phone, or partner with someone who does. Wear clothes and shoes you don't mind getting wet or dirty.\n\nMeet-up location: Ingles Parking Lot 1572 Sand Hill Rd, Candler, NC 28715\n\n\nPhoto Release & Waiver of Liability: all participants must read and agree:\nThere are certain risks inherent in any outdoor activity.
