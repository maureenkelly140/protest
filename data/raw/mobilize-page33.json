    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\n\nTrump has gone too far, defying our courts, deporting American citizens, disappearing people off the streets, and slashing our services—all while orchestrating a massive giveaway to his billionaire allies. And now he is using OUR tax dollars to pay for HIS party. That’s why we say: no crowns, no thrones, no kings. \n\nOn June 14, we celebrate People Power. Grab your signs and join us, noon to 1:30 pm, for a “We the People” One-Mile Rally along the south side of Marine Drive in Astoria. Bring a friend (or five or ten) so we can spread out and fill an entire people-powered mile.\n\nThe line-up will run from 18th to 35th Streets. Don’t park in the Maritime Museum or Coast Guard lots. We’re staying on the south side to avoid pedestrian crossings of Marine Drive and make a strong showing.  \n\nThis is a nonviolent protest in celebration of We the People. During the protest, we’ll have opportunities for you to share your community-building stories on video.\n\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

Buyers spent an estimated $148 million to win the opportunity to dine with the president.\n\nLet’s be clear: This dinner is corruption embodied. Offering special access to the president in exchange for a scheme that enriches the president borders on bribery. America is not for sale! \n\nThat’s why we’re gathering outside his crypto-corruption dinner to hold him accountable and to urge the Justice Department, the Office of Government Ethics, and Congress to hold him accountable too. \n\nWe deserve a president who is responsive to the needs of the American people, not the greed of his crypto bro donors and billionaires.

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

This is an opportunity for World Pride attendees, DMV area residents, and the entire LGBTQ+ community to rally around Andry as we demand his return!\n\nAndry is a 31-year-old gay make-up artist and asylum seeker from Venezuela. Despite seeking safety in the United States due to persecution, Andry was unjustly and illegally disappeared to CECOT, an El Salvadorian prison known for its human rights abuses. After months in detention, and missing his asylum hearing, his lawyer lost contact. We demand his immediate return and the chance to present his asylum claim.\n\nThis injustice against Andry is an attack on the entire LGBTQ+ community and the right to seek refuge.\n\nWe'll hear from:\n\n-Jon Lovett, Host of Lovett or Leave It and Co-Host of Pod Save America\n\n-Lindsay Toczylowski, Andry’s Lawyer and President & CEO of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center\n\n-Tim Miller, Host of The Bulwark Podcast\n\n-Sarah Longwell, Publisher of The Bulwark and Host of The Focus Group Podcast\n\nJoin us on Friday the 6th to hear the latest on Andry’s case, and raise your voice in support.",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n-We are meeting on the **Courthouse Steps** and then marching to the sidewalk in solidarity. \n\n-Safety Volunteers Needed please email- 50501Collier@proton.me to assist. \n\n-A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

    "description": "At Your Favorite National Monument\n\nBackground\n\nIn April, The Washington Post reported that the Trump administration has a short list of six national monuments they’re considering slashing: Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon (AZ), Ironwood Forest (AZ), Chuckwalla (CA), Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks (NM), Bears Ears (UT) and Grand Staircase-Escalante (UT). President Trump has already signed a proclamation opening up the Pacific Islands Heritage National Monuments to commercial fishing.\n\nPublic land advocates have a narrow window to push back and protect these and other places. In 2017, Trump led the largest rollback of public land protections in history, slashing Utah’s Bears Ears and Grand-Staircase Escalante national monuments by 85 and 47 percent, respectively. In response, nearly 3 million Americans rose up in protest.  Let’s build a loud community of public land defenders across the country. Let the Trump administration know these places are for the people - not billionaires or corporate polluters.   \n\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\nWe hope this day of action will generate media attention at local, state and national levels with visuals of people uniting across some of our country’s most precious landscapes. Even small rallies with honed messaging in critical locations are effective. Additionally, a social media element that reaches voters across the country who support public lands will create a powerful message.\n\nWe invite all public land defenders to participate, whether that’s by posting a photo of their favorite trails to social on June 7 or showing up in person on the land with friends and family. \n\nHow to Join\n\nGather a Group: Bring friends, family, or your organization members to your favorite national monument, national park, or other close-to-home public land.\nView a list of BLM-managed National Monuments and Conservation Lands here.\nView a list of National Park Service-managed national monuments and national parks in New Mexico here.\nBefore you go: If you invite a large group, call the land manager to see if a permit will be required for your expected group size or if there are any other considerations for First Amendment activities. Some monuments have designated First Amendment areas.\n\nMake a homemade sign: Use example slogans or create your own.\n\"Not for Sale / No Se Vende\"\n“Protect Our Parks”\n“Public Lands in Public Hands”\n\"Hands Off National Monuments\"\n\"Protect Sacred Sites\"\n\"Public Lands, Not Private Profit\"\nTake photos\nStand near a national monument sign, notable landmark or gorgeous view.\nShow your signs clearly.\nIf you see signs of destruction and negative impacts from the DOGE firing spree (think: trash at trailheads, “closed” signs, etc), document them and report them to New Mexico Wild here.\nShare online - and pass forward\nTag: #nmwild so we can share your photos!\nTag: #monumentsforall | #handsoff | #notforsale \nTag: Sec. Burgum (@secretaryburgum) and your members of Congress (find your reps here)\nTag: 5 friends, nominating them to go to their favorite monument, park or other public land with a sign.\nSign and share the petition\nCall your members of Congress at (202) 224-3121 and tell them to let the Trump administration know that these places are not for sale.\nWho’s Invited to Join\n\nLocal residents\nTribal Nations & Indigenous advocates\nBusiness owners\nOutdoor recreationists (hikers, climbers, birders, campers)\nHunters & anglers\nConservation groups\nFaith leaders\nArtists & youth\nYOU\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe Trump administration is dismantling our parks to sell them off to billionaires and big corporations. These actions will cut off access to national public lands and destroy wildlife habitats. Removing these monument protections is part of the broader scheme to sell off public lands - and Americans’ shared national heritage.\n\nWe say: Enough is enough. These lands are not for sale.\n\n*** here is the link to the NMWild website where you can click on the link to \"share the petition\" and to RSVP\n\nhttps://www.nmwild.org/event/june-7th-day-of-action-rally-for-your-public-lands/",

This is an opportunity for World Pride attendees, DMV area residents, and the entire LGBTQ+ community to rally around Andry as we demand his return! \n\nAndry is a 31-year-old gay make-up artist and asylum seeker from Venezuela. Despite seeking safety in the United States due to persecution, Andry was unjustly and illegally disappeared to CECOT, an El Salvadorian prison known for its human rights abuses. After months in detention, and missing his asylum hearing, his lawyer lost contact. We demand his immediate return and the chance to present his asylum claim. \n\nThis injustice against Andry is an attack on the entire LGBTQ+ community and the right to seek refuge.\n\nWe'll hear from:\n\n- Jon Lovett, Host of Lovett or Leave It and Co-Host of Pod Save America\n- Lindsay Toczylowski, Andry’s Lawyer and President & CEO of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center \n- Tim Miller, Host of The Bulwark Podcast \n- Sarah Longwell, Publisher of The Bulwark and Host of The Focus Group Podcast \n\nJoin us on Friday the 6th to hear the latest on Andry’s case, and raise your voice in support.",

They are our neighbors, coworkers, teachers, caregivers, and friends, making up nearly 10% of North Carolina’s population and an essential part of our communities.\n\nBut right now they are facing cruel federal immigration enforcement activities terrorizing communities and bills moving through the NC General Assembly that would make our state play an even bigger role in this inhumane process. \n\nThis is the moment where we must stand together in opposition to these harmful policies and for the kind of state and people we want to be. Your voice is needed right now to stand alongside our immigrant neighbors and speak out for those who may feel unsafe speaking up themselves. \n\nIf your situation is such that you feel safe doing so, we urge you to join us Wednesday, May 21, for the NC Immigrant Rights Day of Action. RSVP now to let us know to expect you!\n\nHere are all the details:\n\nWhat: NC Immigrant Rights Day of Action\n\nWhen: Wednesday, May 21, 10 am to 1 pm\n\nWhere: Gather at the Bicentennial Plaza, directly across the street from the North Carolina General Assembly, 16 West Jones St., Raleigh, NC \n\nJoin MomsRising/ MamásConPoder and our partners as we stand together in solidarity for the NC we all deserve. Let us know to look for you by RSVPing now.",

    "description": "People from all over the world come to southern Arizona to experience the great outdoors, recreate, and just be among the area’s scenic landscapes and wildlife. But how much is that worth, and what are the costs if it’s lost? \n\nJoin Sky Island Alliance for our next virtual Coffee Break on June 12 at 9:30 a.m. We’ll be joined by Borderlands Restoration Network board member Chuck Klingenstein, who will share results from the first [Nature-Based Restorative Economy study](https://santacruzcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Santa-Cruz-County-NBRE-Full-Report.pdf) in Santa Cruz County, commissioned by the community and conducted by the University of Arizona. \n\nThis in-depth study looked at the many benefits nature provides to our economy in southern Arizona through ecotourism, conservation, and other activities. SIA Executive Director Louise Misztal will also provide updates on South32’s Hermosa Mine in the Patagonia Mountains and how you can speak up for this natural gem that supports our well-being and economy by taking action during the current comment period on the mine’s impacts.\n\n**More Background**\n\nThe Nature-Based Restorative Economy study was conducted by the University of Arizona, and it was commissioned by the Town of Patagonia, Sky Island Tourism Association, Borderlands Restoration Network, Tucson Bird Alliance, The Nature Conservancy, Patagonia Area Resource Alliance, and Sky Island Alliance, as well as other organizations, businesses, and individuals active in Santa Cruz County, Arizona. The purpose of the study was to understand the components of the nature-based restorative economy in Santa Cruz County by using traditional economic modeling. The study also separated out these components, since the nature-based restorative economy isn’t currently a defined sector in government data sets.\n\nSpecific Study Goals\n\n- To define the components of the nature-based restorative economy in Santa Cruz County and collect data on its contribution to the overall economy. This was the first time this has been done.\n\n- To measure the growth of the nature-based restorative economy sector by collecting baseline data for future comparison.\n\n- To inform elected officials and other policymakers, businesses, nonprofits, and the public about the current economic impacts and potential opportunities for growth afforded by the nature-based restorative economy in Santa Cruz County.",

A rally and food drive is planned for Friday, June 6th, 2025. Community members are invited to gather for Democracy Day Sioux Falls from 5:00 to 7:00 pm on 12th and Kiwanis in Sioux falls. Rally goers are encouraged to bring signs showing their support, along with a non perishable food donation for Vets in need.\nOrganized by the same group of anonymous citizens of the April 19th rally and food drive at Van Eps park, an event provided a 3,400 pound food donation and raised over $4000.00 given to Feeding South Dakota. Hopes for a larger turn out at the USS South Dakota Battleship Memorial are high with the event planned to also remember the historic events of June 6th, 1944 and the invasion of Normandy. \n“The memorial is sometimes overlooked for its significance in history. It was called Battleship X to protect its identity in the Pacific theater, because of its success in combat, defending freedom during World War II, ending the fascist regime of the Axis Powers. It’s appropriate to gather there on the anniversary of D-Day to demand better care and protections for our Service Members today.”  organizers said.\nNon-perishable food items and cash donations will support local South Dakota DAV Arthur H. Muchow Chapter No.1. Those interested in donating but not able to stay for the rally will be able to drive through and drop off donations. A DAV trailer will be at the site for the duration of the event.\nThe public is called to make an impact in awareness of the concerns of the community. For more information on volunteering or attending an event page is available on Facebook, find it by searching #DemocracyDaySiouxFalls\nVolunteer sign up can be found at https://forms.gle/yU7XxgfwiAWog4TE8\n###\nContact: QUGSiouxFalls@gmail.com\nQueen City Underground on Facebook\nwww.facebook.com/events/2439234963100362",

    "description": "We’re reaching out because Sarasota County students urgently need your support.\n\nSarasota County Schools has drafted changes to its Student Code of Conduct that would remove key protections for all students, including our LGBTQ youth. This harmful action will send a message that some students are less worthy of safety and respect. Sarasota County Schools has no basis to remove language that affirms the ability for LGBTQ students to “attend school in an environment where all students and adults are treated equally”. \n\nDespite what the district says, this is not about compliance or any legal requirement. There are no State or Federal laws or any Executive Orders over the last 100 days, requiring school districts to remove any of these student protections. This decision will simply result in more harassment, increased bullying instances, and strips our students of the right to attend a safe school.\n\nNow is the time to speak up. We need you to attend the school board meeting, share a public comment, and show that this community stands up for all students.\n\nWe urge Sarasota County Schools to focus on creating safe, fair, and welcoming schools. This is the bare minimum to ensure every student wants to attend school, feels safe, and can focus on their academics. Sarasota County Schools must prioritize student safety and learning, not subject our kids to harassment and discrimination.",

We demand our medical institutions do not comply with anti-trans, unconstitutional attacks on young people's healthcare. We demand Phoenix Children's Hospital reinstate this life-saving, life-affirming care trans youth deserve and need to thrive. \n\nThis action is a Speak Out. Our community will gather at the corner outside of Phoenix Children's Hospital and listen to youth, community leaders, and medical professionals speak to the importance of gender-affirming care through speeches and chants. We also encourage attendees in our community step up to the mic and share their own stories. Attendees are encouraged to bring signs, and friends!\n \nThis action is co-organized by The Feminist Front, Young Feminist Party, and Queerizona.

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.** Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

He has now spoken to the Waupun city council and is smearing the name of one of the board members spouse as he continues to push back against this censorship request. \nThere was a large showing for speakers, almost unanimously in opposition to the censorship, at the February board meeting. Since then, he has sent yet another letter to the board calling for his own religion be used as a guide for content, material and displays at the PUBLIC library. \nLet’s help support the overwhelming consensus among the community that censorship does NOT belong in our public libraries.\nPlan to meet at the Waupun Public Library, 123 S Forest St, Waupun, WI at 4pm. Protestors should line the street on both S Forest and E Brown streets. Board meeting begins at 4:30pm. If you wish to speak, you must sign in prior to the meeting start - there is limited seating in the board room (a capacity of about 100 seats). \nParking is limited and is mostly street parking.",

Everyone can vote, and all votes matter. Free speech and due process are for all. All people can control their own bodies. People are more important than corps. No child is hungry or homeless. No one goes without health care. Buying a house is achievable. College if possible for anyone. \n\nWe can rebuild with a stronger foundation than before. So what are YOUR dreams?\n\nCome join us for a peaceful rally and sharing of what a Future America might look like to you. \n\nMay 31, 10-noon - Vigo County Courthouse",

    "description": "June 6, 2025, marks the 81st anniversary of D-Day, the day the Allied forces launched the biggest sea invasion with a singular goal: overthrow the fascists of Nazi Germany. This year, we will honor the many men who fought and died that day, and we will continue their fight – this time on America’s shores and in America’s streets.  On Friday, June 6, veterans and their allies will join once again for a rally in front of the Marin Veterans Memorial Auditorium.\n\nThis rally will take place on the same day as the primary gathering on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., as well as in state capitols, large cities and small towns. Veterans and military family members are being fired by the thousands from federal jobs. Their healthcare is being gutted. Their benefits are under siege. We rally to:\n\nDefend veteran and military family member employment in the federal workforce;\n\nStop the privatization and weakening of the Department of Veterans Affairs; and\n\nHold political leaders accountable for policies that harm veterans and their families.\n\nThe rally will include firsthand accounts from veterans and their providers on the difficulties they are experiencing in receiving and providing care. \n\n\n\n[Photo by ProBonoPhoto.org/Stephanie Mohan]",

    "description": "Representative Pramila Jayapal has worked with experts in the fields and developed a \"Resistance Lab\" course. You can join the next one on June 1st virtually [here](https://www.mobilize.us/pramilaforcongress/event/775585/). But for people in the Seattle area, we are planning an in-person session to watch the training together. The course includes group exercises, which would be much easier and fun to do together in person. \n\nWe will be meeting at a Seattle Public Library branch in the University District area. Please note, this event is NOT hosted, sponsored, or endorsed by The Seattle Public Library. Any views that are discussed in this meeting are not a reflection of The Seattle Public Library’s views.\n\n**This in-person meeting has limited capacity. We kindly ask you to only sign up if you plan to attend the session. If your plan changes, please cancel your registration promptly so that others can sign up and we can prepare accordingly. **\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact us via this [form](https://forms.gle/GCAi5a6m45SvyP1g9).\n\n### What is the Resistance Lab? \n(copied from [Representative Jayapal's page](https://www.pramilaforcongress.com/the-resistance-lab))\n\nThe Resistance Lab is a series of trainings that are developed specifically for this moment. We look at how non-violent movements around the world have responded to leaders who seize power in authoritarian ways and the most effective tools and tactics to utilize in these moments.  We offer frameworks to understand this moment at home, and incorporate interactive conversation with others to help create community and build our resistance movement.   \n\nThe Resistance Lab was developed with experts who have researched and studied democratic backsliding around the world as well as in the United States and the non-violent movements that have emerged to challenge those authoritarian leaders.  We also draw from many toolkits for effective tactics and frameworks as well as from Pramila’s own background leading successful organizing movements for economic and social justice for two decades.  \n\nOur goals are to help people understand how democracies fall and the most effective resistance movements that have challenged authoritarians and dictators; to turn anger, fear and frustration into action in the short-term while also preparing for a coordinated resistance movement for the longer term; and to build community across the country that can help grow our movement.  At the end of the day, we want to get people strike-ready and street-ready and make sure we protect our people, our freedoms and our democracy.  \n\nWith Trump and his MAGA billionaires doubling down on their attacks on the economic livelihoods of people to thrive and on our democracy, we can’t afford to sit this moment out. This is about building real power together.

(see map)  The big sign there is for the restaurant, Flemings.\n\nThe rally is in the shade and during morning rush hour, so it will be relatively cool but with a lot of visibility. Stay as long or as little as you like.\n\nParking is right across Siesta Drive in the empty shopping mall parking lot.\n\nBy persisting week after week, we are showing the people of Sarasota that we are in this for the long term and will persevere as long as necessary.\n\nExpect lots of supportive honking of horns.\nBring your own sign about Social Security or any other topic related to the resistance against the MAGA attack on our democracy.\n\nSee you there!",
