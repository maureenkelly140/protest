They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",

    "description": "From coast to coast, protests are clearly working!  A recent poll shows that 56% of independents (our target market!) believe “Trump is a dangerous dictator whose power should be limited.”  We’re glad they agree with us!\n\nYet Republicans continue to bend the knee to Trump, with efforts to pass his “big beautiful budget.” \n\nWe believe his budget is toxic and will create devastating consequences for all of us, especially children, the elderly and veterans.  So why do Republicans want it?  To give more tax cuts to the rich!\n\nWe are fighting back with another protest!\n\nTHEME:  TRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET \n\nWHEN: Friday, May 23rd, 3 to 4 pm\n\nWHERE: 32051 Camino Capistrano, SJC (Intersection of Camino Capistrano and Del Obispo.  Please meet near Ross Dress for Less.)\n\nResearch proves that protests are only effective when they have a focused message. Please focus all signs on TRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET.  For example:\n\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET KICKS GRANDMA OUT OF HER NURSING HOME!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET CUTS CANCER RESEARCH!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET BETRAYS THE ELDERLY!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET CUTS FOOD BANK $$$!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET CUTS EDUCATION!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET BENEFITS BILLIONAIRES—NOT YOU!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET BETRAYS VETS!\n\nWe’re not trying to limit free speech, we’re strategizing for maximum impact, so please stay on message.\n\nWe had over 2,000 people at our last protest. We can have 4,000 at this one if you bring just one friend!\n\nAs Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said, “These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace…Are you ready for the fight?”\n\nWe are!\n\nAnn & Darcie, Co-chairs\nDWSOC Rapid Response Team",

This is a highly visible spot, with thousands of cars per hour. Our weekly presence gives hope and inspiration to passers by who have not yet resolved to take action. And everyone who attends draws fresh energy from one another and from the community response. \n\nAll participants share the responsibility to keep this gathering safe and peaceful. Use the lights to cross Shelburne Rd; don't engage in negative exchanges with passing drivers, and stay on public property. This is a peaceful demonstration that falls under our First Amendment rights to public assembly and freedom of speech. \n\nParking: Head west on Hannaford Drive. Make a left onto Fayette Road (just before Lowe's). There's plenty of parking on both sides of the road.",

    "description": "We proudly invite you to join our May General Membership Meeting and Social on Wednesday, May 14th, held at 1920 Ybor, Social from 6:00 pm to 6:30 pm meeting will be from 6:30 pm - 8 pm!\n\nThis month, we are proud to welcome Curtis Lopez-Galloway & Samuel Nieves from the Conversion Therapy Survivor Network! \n\nThe Conversion Therapy Survivor Network is a U.S.-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded and led by survivors of conversion therapy. Its mission is to unite individuals who have endured sexual and/or gender identity change and suppression efforts, providing a supportive community that addresses the lasting impact of these practices. The organization offers a safe space for survivors to share their experiences and connect with others who have faced similar trauma, fostering healing through shared understanding and connection.\n\nhttps://www.conversionsurvivor.org\n\nCurtis Lopez-Galloway (Founder & President) - Palm Springs, CA - grew up in a small town in Southern Illinois. When he was 16 years old he was subjected to conversion therapy; an experience he was later able to use to ban conversion therapy in his home State. Curtis went on to be a leading figure in many LGBTQ+ organizations in the Midwest. Now living in California, Curtis has taken his activism to the next level and founded the Conversion Therapy Survivor Network to bring survivors of conversion therapy together in community and solidarity. In his free time, Curtis likes to try new food, hike nature trails, explore new places, and enjoy nights on the couch.\n\nSamuel Nieves (Board Director) - Tacoma, WA - a dynamic advocate and dedicated supporter of Survivors, is known for his vocal opposition to conversion therapy. He actively engages with social media, sharing insights, holding practitioners accountable, and openly discussing his own experiences with conversion therapy. Hailing from a Mexican American background and raised in Provo, Utah, Samuel pursued a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, which he successfully obtained in 2019. Subsequently, he embarked on a journey in marriage and family therapy. While he ultimately left the therapy field, Samuel continues to play a pivotal role by facilitating weekly community meetings and providing much-needed support.\n\nPARKING UPDATE: There is Ybor Parking Lot #3 directly behind the 1920 Ybor, across the street at the intersection of 6th Ave. and 20th St. The first two hours of parking are free!",

They are threatening to interfere with the implementation of the Pregnant Worker's Fairness Act, to limit the enforcement of the freedom of access to abortion clinic entrances (FACE) act and preventing the use federal money to fund or support abortions. 47 has signed an executive order, ordering the evaluation of all pending proceedings under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), which was first passed in 1974 and amended in 1976 to prevent lenders from discriminating against women based on marital status. The administration is also making cuts to programs that affect Women's Healthcare especially in areas considered healthcare deserts including the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOn Saturday, May 10th we will have a march and Family Fun Day in Tucker, GA to show our support for moms.

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "The current administration has been actively targeting programs that affect women's health, family life and family economics. They are threatening to interfere with the implementation of the Pregnant Worker's Fairness Act, to limit the enforcement of the freedom of access to abortion clinic entrances (FACE) act and preventing the use federal money to fund or support abortions. 47 has signed an executive order, ordering the evaluation of all pending proceedings under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), which was first passed in 1974 and amended in 1976 to prevent lenders from discriminating against women based on marital status. The administration is also making cuts to programs that affect Women's Healthcare especially in areas considered healthcare deserts including the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOn Saturday, May 10th we will have a march and Family Fund Day in Tucker, GA to show our support for moms who have been affected by the policies of the current administration. The event will be at the City of Tucker's Church Steet Park. The park can be seen from LaVista Rd. and is the same park where the city has the Movie on the Green event each month during the spring and summer months.",

    "description": "Edge of Appalachia Ohio Indivisible is partnering with Women’s March for this Nationwide creative action protest! 👏🏼🎪🎡🎠🤡\n\n“When you elect clowns, they don’t become leaders. The country becomes a circus.\n\nOn June 14, Donald Trump will honor himself with a four-mile military parade in our nation’s capitol. Trump’s tacky parade was inspired by dictators he idolizes, and will cost taxpayers nearly $100 million. \n\nOrganizer and strategist Daniel Hunter has written that “Humor is important for our psyches — and to take fascists down a notch[…] Humor is key for morale and exposing the vulnerability of the strongman image.” This is where the ridiculous meets the resistance—and where the future is on the line.\n\nJune 14 is our chance to reflect the absurdity of the MAGA regime and the clowns who lead it. To meet this moment, Women’s March will host community circuses nationwide—bold, creative actions that mirror the chaos MAGA has sown across the country. Together, we’ll set a national record for the most circuses held in a single day while we simultaneously refuse to celebrate a petty clown who desperately wants to be seen as strong. We won’t stop until we build the country we all deserve.\n`\nOur grassroots street circuses turn satire into resistance and reclaim the big tent for democracy.”\n\nWho’s ready to participate in a circus theme protest?!🤡🎪🎡🤹🏼‍♀️🎠\n\nWe need creatives, musicians visual art presenters, A JUGGLER, etc. If you have any circus decorations already we could borrow or find any thrifting we’d love to borrow! We’ll also be looking for a popcorn machine.\n\nWe’ll be reaching out to the city of Hillsboro to see what it takes to shut down a whole road or intersection.👏🏼\n\n#KickOutTheClowns\n#GreatestShitshowOnEarth\n#CommunitiesNotClowns\n#ClownsAgainstClowns \n#BigTentResistance",

We are also coming up with a donation drive to help support our communities.\n\n***More details on the agenda for the day coming soon.\n\nRemember what we are focused on. Do not let agitators or aggressors get a negative rise out of us, they are only distracting us from our goal, our movement. If we are approached by such folks we will step back and chant protect the constitution and this is what community looks like.\n\nThere are 2 free public parking lots near the meeting location, 3 and 5 minute walks as well as 2 hour parking directly in front of where we will be. Please stay as long as you possibly can if not the whole protest time. We need as many there as we can for the entire time.

But we know the truth: this land already refuses the violence of occupation and the lie of American kingship. \n\nHawaiʻi was once an independent nation, illegally overthrown by U.S. interests. We had a Queen. We had a flag. And we continue to fight for sovereignty, for our language, our lands, and our people.\n\nWe say no to:\n • American kings and strongmen\n • Corporate oligarchy and the Big Five legacy\n • Military expansion and settler colonialism\n • Fascism dressed up as patriotism\n\nWe rally at the so-called “State” Capitol to remind them: this isn’t their land to govern. Hawaiʻi was, and still is, an occupied nation.\n\nWe show up with the symbols that represent us:\n 🏳️‍🌈 Pride flags\n 🇵🇭 Philippine flags\n 🇵🇸 Palestinian flags\n 🏴 Hawaiian flags\n 🇲🇽 Mexican flags\n ✊🏾 Anything that affirms your story and your resistance.\n\nOn June 14, we show up, not to feed anyone’s ego, but to build a future rooted in truth, justice, and community power.\n\n“E iho ana o luna, e pi‘i ana o lalo.”\n The top will fall, and the bottom will rise.\n\nKū i ka pono.

William Barber, who founded the Center for Public Theology and Public Policy at Yale and now teaches there.\n\nOn the twelfth anniversary of his first \"Moral Monday\" demonstration, Monday April 28, 2025, Rev. Barber was arrested for praying against the Republican-led budget while in the Rotunda of our US Capitol. At a rally held before he entered the Rotunda to pray, Rev. Barber said: “Forty-three percent of women and almost half of all children are poor and low income. Somebody ought to say something … Somebody gotta challenge this budget.”\n\nWe are holding \"Moral Monday\" street rallies to voice our challenges.\n\nWe oppose Republican-approved Congressional budget resolutions that harm the poorest and most vulnerable of Americans in order to give more than $5-trillion in tax breaks to the richest and most privileged of Americans.\n\nWe oppose Trump/Musk budget proposals that eliminate or make draconian cuts to federal programs for child care, health research, education, housing assistance, community development, and the elderly.\n\nThese funding cuts and proposed budgets are not just public policy choices, they are moral choices. \n\nThese funding cuts and proposed budgets are morally wrong, not just bad public policy choices. \n\nPlease join with us to \"say something\" and \"challenge this budget\".",

    "description": "Please join us in opposing cuts to essential safety net programs!\n\nPlease join us at weekly recurring  \"Moral Monday\" street rallies, alternating between Hudson WI and River Falls WI.\n\nOur first “Moral Monday” street rally will be in Downtown Hudson on Monday May 5, from 4PM to 6PM, at the intersection of Second and Vine Streets, where we will hold signs and stand along the public sidewalks.\n\nOur second “Moral Monday” street rally will be in River Falls on Monday May 12, from 4PM to 6PM, at the intersection of Main and Division Streets, where we will hold signs and stand along the public sidewalks.\n\nFolks may join for part or all the two hours, and may bring their own signs or use signs we’ll have to share.\n\nIf the weather is bad—hard rain, high wind, and/or lightening—we’ll cancel that week’s rally.\n\nOur \"Moral Monday\" street rallies are inspired and informed by work of the prominent North Carolina pastor and anti-poverty activist the Rev. William Barber, who founded the Center for Public Theology and Public Policy at Yale and now teaches there.\n\nOn the twelfth anniversary of his first \"Moral Monday\" demonstration, Monday April 28, 2025, Rev. Barber was arrested for praying against the Republican-led budget while in the Rotunda of our US Capitol. At a rally held before he entered the Rotunda to pray, Rev. Barber said: “Forty-three percent of women and almost half of all children are poor and low income. Somebody ought to say something … Somebody gotta challenge this budget.”\n\nWe are holding \"Moral Monday\" street rallies to voice our challenges.\n\nWe oppose Republican-approved Congressional budget resolutions that harm the poorest and most vulnerable of Americans in order to give more than $5-trillion in tax breaks to the richest and most privileged of Americans.\n\nWe oppose Trump/Musk budget proposals that eliminate or make draconian cuts to federal programs for child care, health research, education, housing assistance, community development, and the elderly.\n\nThese funding cuts and proposed budgets are not just public policy choices, they are moral choices. \n\nThese funding cuts and proposed budgets are morally wrong, not just bad public policy choices. \n\nPlease join with us to \"say something\" and \"challenge this budget\".",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "In 2025, Virginia is a political battleground—and the stakes couldn't be higher. MAGA and Project 2025 are working to roll back voting rights, suppress opposition, and dismantle fundamental protections like due process. But their efforts won’t stop at Virginia’s borders.\n\nWhat happens in one swing state can ripple across the country. \n\nSacramento voters should pay attention—because when MAGA and Project 2025 tactics take hold in one place, they often spread, shaping national laws, court decisions, and public opinion everywhere.\nJoin us for a critical conversation with Delegate Michael Feggans, a 20-year Air Force veteran and state legislator, about how he’s standing up for democracy in Virginia—and why his fight is our fight, too. \n\nDelegate Feggans will discuss his legislative priorities, including:\n**Reproductive Rights:** Advocating for the protection of reproductive freedoms.\n**Public Education:** Supporting increased funding and resources for public schools.\n**Veteran Affairs:** Assisting veterans in transitioning to high-tech career fields.\n**Gun Safety:** Promoting common-sense gun safety measures.\n\nWith a background in both military service and technology entrepreneurship, Delegate Feggans brings a unique perspective to the General Assembly. He is committed to serving the community that raised him and addressing the complex challenges ahead with compassionate leadership.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you on Monday May 12!",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego.

    "description": "Wow! What a great location for a standout! A few of us tried it out on Friday, May 2. There's a full-size sidewalk on the west side, and a narrow sidewalk (kind of like the narrow sidewalk at Mountain Park Rd.) on the east side. The west side will accommodate more people than the east side.\n\nThere's lots and lots of traffic passing by. Southampton Road (Routes 10/202) is heavily traveled northbound and southbound, and the Mass Pike eastbound and westbound is below. Lots of honks and thumbs up and waves...and a few folks flying middle fingers. We smile and wave at them all! \n\nWe'll have letterboards prepared for the lower part of the overpass fencing - the photo shows how that will look to folks passing on the Mass Pike. We're interacting with motorists on the Mass Pike, and on Southampton Road. We've discovered that the magic happens when we smile and wave to people!\n\nCome when you can, and leave when you must. You needn't be present for the entire 2-hour standout.\n\n### How to Get There\n\nThe address \"130 Southampton Road, Westfield\" will get you just north of the overpass. \n\n### Parking\n\nWe can't park in the Southampton Rd breakdown lane. There's a vacant business property three or four properties north of the bridge, and it seems that parking would be OK there.\n\nIt looks like The Wealth Technology Group has vacated their office at 130 Southampton Rd, but the internet says that other businesses are located there, so please be mindful if you decide to park there.\n\n### Etiquette!\n\nWe don't give the finger to people who give the finger to us, or who say unpleasant things. We smile and wave to them, too. \n\nWe may see a counter protester. If so, the best thing to do is just ignore them and spend our time and energy waving to motorists. Let's keep things 100% non-confrontational in words and body language.\n\n### Other Stuff\n\nPlease take everything you brought away with you, and leave the site totally clean.\n\nIf rain is predicted, we'll cancel. If we cancel, you'll receive an email notification.\n\n### A Few Requests\n\nWe've found that roof rake sections make wonderful flagpoles and banner poles. If you have a roof rake (or 10’-15’ light metal poles or conduit) to contribute, we'll be happy to take it off your hands!\n\nDonations...we've purchased banners and grommets and flags and zip ties and bungee cords, and we'll be getting more. We’ve purchased 20” x 30” letter boards for messaging we can change. All this costs $$$. We'll have a bucket for donations, and if you could throw something in, that'd be great. And if not, that's perfectly OK, too - your presence is what's really important. See where the money's going! https://tinyurl.com/IN-SLWMProtestTeamFinancials\n\n\nphoto: Rob Robertson",

We expect all hosts and participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.\n\n(If you want to try to go in, be prepared for it to be not-easy. The building management would like to limit visitors to three at a time and for all others to stay outside. So why not stay outside and let other Arkansans know what's going on?)

Mobilize requires you to put in a location.\n\nThis is a letter or postcard writing campaign that you can do on your own time.\n\nHere is what  the Fix Our Forests Act would do:\n\nThe Fix Our Forests Act presents a contentious approach to forest management, balancing wildfire mitigation efforts with environmental and public participation concerns. \n\nHR 471 passed the House.  The Senate has yet to vote.\n\nThis legislation does little to invest in research-based wildlife protections.   \n\nInstead, it focuses on opening federal lands to logging interests.  It also bypasses critical environmental laws, including the Endangered Species Act, that protect our ecosystems. It also restricts scientific input and public engagement.  The bill could have devastating consequences for the environment and endangered species.\n\nHere is a simple letter you can copy and paste to email or write to your SENATORS:\n\nDear Senator,\n\nI am writing to urge Senator _______ to oppose HR 471, the Fix Our Forests Act, which recently passed the House.  I oppose this bill because:\n\n- It ignores proven wildfire community protection measures and prioritizes opening federal lands to logging interests.\n-It will open millions of acres of federal land to logging without scientific review or community input.\n- It encourages the removal of large old trees that mitigate climate change by storing high amounts of carbon.\n-It could lead to increased road density and increased risk of human-caused fires.\n- It guts key pieces of the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nYour Constituent,\n\nYour name.",

    "description": "Zoom Informational meetings about June 16-28 march from Philly to DC\n\nDemocracy 12 aims to inspire concerned citizens of all stripes to rise up in peaceful, happy, and creative protest.\n\nWe are doing this by taking a walk–a rather long walk–from Philadelphia to DC.\n\nThat’s the big picture.\n\nHere are our two big goals:\n\nONE:\n\nWe hope to find a core group of 12 walkers. \n\nThis mission needs a human-powered spirit team, and this group has to be everything we want our democracy to be: peaceful, civil, inspired and inspiring.  Committed and reliable.  Ready to set aside ordinary things. \n\nIf you’re possibly interested in becoming part of the core team, reach out, check us out. We get that becoming a core walker is a dive-in decision, so it's probably best if you get a feel for who we are and what we are doing to make the core group a team that’s happily, totally into it. Accommodations and meals will be on a sliding-scale for this group, as we desire to have a diverse group joining us.  If you cannot make the whole walk due to other obligations please don't let that stop you from inquiring.\n\n​\n\nTWO:\n\nWe hope that our walk will inspire and support local creativity, community, and peaceful resistance, all along the way.  \n\nThis is how our march becomes your march, and actually, it’s sort of  like everyone’s march.   \n\nSo many concerned citizens are already creating and connecting in peaceful, resolute resistance, and it's already making a difference...\n\nLet's keep on keeping on.\n\nCheck out our website www.democracy12.com. We hope to see you soon!\n\n[NOTE: Because we want to make sure we're in friendly company, we ask that you have your video enabled.]",

There is a drop off section where people hold their signs. There should be a ramp there. If you want to get as close as possible, there is an option to turn left on the side of Roundhouse/State Capitol and you can pull up to the curb at the crosswalk where a ramp is located.\n\nThere is also an accessible entrance to the Roundhouse/State Capitol through \"Capitol North\" on Don Gaspar Avenue (the one-way street). Follow the blue accessibility signs to the ramp and to the accessible entrance. This option will not accommodate someone with limited mobility who needs direct access and requires a shorter distance.\n\nPhysical Address: 490 Old Santa Fe Trail, Santa Fe, NM 87501\nFree parking is available Monday through Friday at 420 Galisteo St.\n\nHelpful links:\nhttps://santafe.com/getting-here/ \nhttps://www.nmlegis.gov/Visitors",

This is a peaceful protest. We will not block streets or businesses along the route.\n\nBring signs, wear black, and make some noise.\n\nFind and reserve your spot here: www.handsacrosschi.com\n\nUsing the website widget will help us spread people out evenly along the route, while keeping people close to where they live.\n\nPresident Trump has defied court orders and forcibly sent people to a torture dungeon in El Salvador without a hearing or due process. Now he claims he’s unable to bring them back. He's ignored court rulings and arrested judges. If he can do this to them, he can do it to anyone.\n\nThese are the actions of a dictator—not a democratically elected president. Silence is not an option. When leaders cross the line into authoritarianism, it’s up to us—the people—to push back. This protest is about more than politics. It's about defending basic human dignity, civil liberties, and the idea that no one is above the law.",

Committed and reliable.  Ready to set aside ordinary things. \n\nIf you’re possibly interested in becoming part of the core team, reach out, check us out. We get that becoming a core walker is a dive-in decision, so it's probably best if you get a feel for who we are and what we are doing to make the core group a team that’s happily, totally into it. Accommodations and meals will be on a sliding-scale for this group, as we desire to have a diverse group joining us.  If you cannot make the whole walk due to other obligations please don't let that stop you from inquiring.\n\nWe will post and email route/hotel information as soon as it is available on our website for both \"core walkers\" and anyone that wants to participate. \n​\n\nTWO:\nWe hope that our walk will inspire and support local creativity, community, and peaceful resistance, all along the way.  \n\nThis is how our march becomes your march, and actually, it’s sort of  like everyone’s march.   \n\nSo many concerned citizens are already creating and connecting in peaceful, resolute resistance, and it's already making a difference...\n\nLet's keep on keeping on.\n\nCheck out our website www.democracy12.com. We hope to see you soon!",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Join Capital Region Indivisible groups and other area activists to protest Elise Stefanik and the GOP at their Spring Picnic in Elm Avenue Park, Bethlehem. \n\nARRIVAL TIME: Plan to be parked and in place by 1:30 when GOP will start arriving. Their event starts at 2:00 and people will arrive before that. Also press often come early and then leave, so we want good numbers early.\n\nPARKING: As you enter the park, the best place to park are the lots on your right behind the tennis courts. If those fill up head to the left and park in the large lots next to the pool complex. Do NOT park by the playground further down. \n\nWHERE WE WILL BE LOCATED: We will be protesting along the road on Rt. 32 and immediately inside the park along the road leading to the parking lots. We are not protesting at the event pavilion as we want to keep this peaceful, AND optics for newspaper pictures will be a lot better with us all at the front of the park.\n\nMESSAGING AND SIGNS: Let's be sure everyone knows the harms the GOP and Stefanik are inflicting on everyday people by their votes to cut benefits and programs (Medicaid, food stamps, rental assistance, benefits for children with disabilities, etc) all so they can give tax breaks for their wealthy donors, corporations and billionaire friends, that Stefanik votes in lock step with the Republican led Congress, and that she is not welcome here!\n\nHANDS OFF ________________ GOP!\nHANDS OFF OUR HEALTHCARE ELISE!\nGO HOME ELISE!\nELISE & GOP VOTE FOR TAX CUTS FOR BILLIONAIRES!\nNO CUTS TO OUR BENEFITS FOR BILLIONAIRE GIVE AWAYS!\nSHAME ON THE GOP!\nELISE, YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE!\n\nSAFETY AND RESTROOMS: We will have trained Safety marshalls circulating and helping to direct you to parking and restrooms. Restrooms are in the warming hut if you are familiar with the park.\n\nEveryone must be committed to non-violence and non-engagement even if provoked. We want a peaceful and powerful demonstration.",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

    "description": "Register on Mobilize, then please go to https://www.handsacrosschi.com/ and enter your zip code to get an assigned location along the route. \n\nJoin tens of thousands of your fellow Chicago-area citizens as we form a human chain of conscience across Chicagoland in peaceful protest against Trump’s illegal and authoritarian actions and the GOP's failure to defend the Constitution.\n\nBring signs, wear black, and make some noise.\n\nWe will line sidewalks along 30 miles from Aurora to Chicago along Ogden Ave, 26th Street and California Ave to Douglass Park. This is a peaceful protest. We will not block streets or businesses along the route.\n\nRegister on Mobilize, then please go to https://www.handsacrosschi.com/ and enter your zip code to get an assigned location along the route. This is important so that we can spread people out evenly along the route, while keeping people closer to where they live. IGNORE THE MAP BELOW; THIS IS NOT YOUR ASSIGNED LOCATION.\n\nPresident Trump has defied court orders and forcibly sent people to a torture dungeon in El Salvador without a hearing or due process. Now he claims he’s unable to bring them back. He's ignored court rulings and arrested judges. If he can do this to them, he can do it to anyone.\n\nThese are the actions of a dictator—not a democratically elected president. Silence is not an option. When leaders cross the line into authoritarianism, it’s up to us—the people—to push back. This protest is about more than politics. It's about defending basic human dignity, civil liberties, and the idea that no one is above the law.\n\nBring your family, friends, neighbors, coworkers—anyone who believes in freedom and democracy.",

This is a highly visible spot, with thousands of cars per hour. Our weekly presence gives hope and inspiration to passersby who have not yet resolved to take action. And everyone who attends draws fresh energy from one another and from the community response.\n\nIndivisible is committed to non-violent action, and all participants share the responsibility to keep this gathering safe and peaceful. This peaceful demonstration falls under our First Amendment rights to public assembly and freedom of speech.\n\n☆ Meet at the intersection of Hannaford Drive and Shelburne Rd. \n\n☆ Parking: Head west on Hannaford Drive. Turn left onto Fayette Road (just before Lowe's). There's plenty of parking on both sides of the road. ***DO NOT PARK ON THE ROAD BORDERING TESLA - it is private property!\n\n☆ Use the lights/crosswalks to cross Shelburne Rd and Hannaford Dr\n☆ Please be respectful of all who interact with us. Do not boo, yell, make any aggressive gestures, or engage in negative exchanges. Thank you! \n☆ Please be safe and stand back from the busy road \n☆ Don't block driveways or pedestrian access \n☆ Stay off private property",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\nSaturday, June 14th is Flag Day and a good time to remind Trump and the MAGA crowd this is OUR flag and we are taking it back from this authoritarian administration. \n\nJune 14 also happens to be the birthday of the narcissistic wannabe King. Trump plans to hold a military parade in DC, so we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings!\n\nWe’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nJoin us at Springfield at City Hall from 12:00-2:00PM.  \nTogether we will rally to declare NO Kings AND to take back our flag!\nThis event is co-hosted by Rise Up Western Mass Indivisible, Indivisible Northampton/Swing Left Western Mass, and Defending Democracy in Hampden County.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We already rejected a Mad King - George III**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**\n🚨 Where: Williamsburg James City County Courthouse, 5201 Monticello Avenue, Williamsburg, VA. 23188 from 5:00pm - 6:30pm.\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump and MAGA. It belongs to all of us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it. We will celebrate \"Old Glory\", our flag that represents our Democracy, as we claim the Red White and Blue!!! We will celebrate all those who fought for our flag, in uniform and on the home front, and all the \"Angels of Democracy\" who are still fighting for her. \n\nA list of speakers will be announced closer to the event.\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t (we will NOT be in D.C.)—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.** 🚨🚨This event is being hosted by Williamsburg JCC Indivisible and Indivisible Essex.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*\n\n**As with our previous events, the same rules apply. We will not engage with counter-protesters. If an issue arises, please notify one of the event organizers, who will be wearing Williamsburg JCC Indivisible t-shirts. We will not engage in any acts of violence or violation of any applicable laws or engage in civil disobedience. All actions will be peaceful. Everyone participating in this event will be required to behave lawfully to ensure the safety of event participants and will seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. We will obey the orders of authorized event marshals and law enforcement authorities. Event organizers will not be responsible for any injury or damage if any were to occur during this event. We will park in the Courthouse parking lot without blocking access lanes and will remove any trash that is left. We are committed to maintaining public health measures to practice safe protesting during these times. Please wear a mask and socially distance if that makes you more comfortable - weigh your own risk in attending. Follow all local safety guidelines at minimum, and any safety instructions from hosts that exceed local law.**",

Bring friends, family, and neighbors. Meet like-minded people, network with others who are concerned for our democracy and SPEAK OUT NOW! \n\nThere are lots of public parking spaces around town.  Please park where you like, and meet us to march up to the Old Courthouse.  We don't want to clog up any of the business parking lots, but if you do park in a business lot, please try to patronize that business :-)\n\nOur first two events in April and May were positive and show the need for this community event!

    "description": "This Mother’s Day, we gather not just with flowers—but with fire in our hearts and justice in our voices. On Saturday, May 10, we rally in honor of all mothers:\n🌸 The ones who raised us in freedom,\n🌸 The ones who are raising the next generation,\n🌸 The ones who dream of becoming moms someday—and deserve the right to choose when and if they do,\n🌸 And the mothers enduring the fallout of failed policies: economic hardship, crumbling healthcare systems, attacks on reproductive freedom, and schools stripped of resources.\n\nThis is also for the mothers of immigrants, of children wrongfully detained, and of communities silenced by cruelty and neglect. It’s for every woman fighting to give her children a better future—and for the daughters who are demanding one.\n\n🚨On Saturday, May 10 from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, we’ll be at Good Trouble Corner (McBean & Valencia Blvd, Santa Clarita) to stand together in solidarity.🚨\n\nWe’re not waiting for change. We are the change. We’re building a movement where every voice counts and every family matters.\n\nA core principle behind this event is a commitment to nonviolence and community care. We expect all participants to uplift each other and de-escalate when needed—we lead with peace, love, and strength. We recommend all participants review our safety and security resource before your event: https://indivisi.org/safety\n\n💌 More Info: www.indivisibleCA27.com\n📧 Contact Us: CA27indivisible@gmail.com\n\nBring your signs. Bring your stories. Bring your love for the women who made you. ✊💐\nLet’s show up for all our mothers—past, present, and future.",

    "description": "Join Sister District Puget Sound to hang out with like-minded folks and sign up to postcard for Lily Franklin!\n\nRunning for the Virginia House of Delegates | District 41 | Challenger\n\nFive generations of Lily Franklin’s family live in southwest Virginia (SWVA). This is her home, and she wants it to be the best possible place to raise a family, live, and retire.\n\nLily’s SWVA roots go deep, she knows that Virginia doesn’t end in Charlottesville and has shared in the pain of neglect with her neighbors. Lily and her brother both graduated from Northside High School. She completed a bachelor’s degree in political science at Longwood University while her brother started a small business in Christiansburg.\n\nLily can put a proven record, established contacts, and in-depth knowledge of the inner workings of our Commonwealth’s government to work for SWVA. She knows the problems we face in SWVA because she lives here. She can bring concrete solutions to these problems from Richmond because she’s worked there.\n\nWe'll be back at the always kid and dog friendly space, Old Stove Ship Canal, rain or shine! \n\n600 W Nickerson St, Seattle, WA 98119\nhttp://www.oldstove.com/shipcanal\n\n2-4PM, 5/18/25\n\nWe hope to see you there! \n\nCheers,\nSister District Puget Sound",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",
