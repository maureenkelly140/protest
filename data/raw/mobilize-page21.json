    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts, undermining the US Constitution and American democracy. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Come join us to knock doors and talk to voters about the upcoming primary election! \n\nAbout Daniel: As the first in his family to go to college, Daniel attended the University of Arizona where he interned for then-Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Daniel was a survivor of the 2011 Tucson shooting and was the first to administer first aid before EMTs arrived on the scene. Turning tragedy into resilience, Daniel decided to live a life of public service to protect Arizonan families and served on the Sunnyside School board (2011-2015) and was later elected to the Arizona State Legislature (2017-2022). Now, Daniel is running for Congress to Fight the Trump Administration to protect Arizonans' social security and healthcare access, expand federal dollars into public education, and lower the cost of everyday goods and housing.",

A spectacle meant to look like strength. But real power isn’t staged in Washington. It rises up everywhere else.\n\nNo Kings is a nationwide day of defiance. From city blocks to small towns, from courthouse steps to community parks, we’re taking action to reject authoritarianism—and show the world what democracy really looks like.\n\nWe’re rallying in Woodstock, VA on the I-81 overpass at exit 283.\n\nWe’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.  See more at NoKings.org",

Pick-Up Equipment** - Sometime **the week of May 19 - May 24,** pick up the tent, table, chairs, and other equipment from CCDP's office in the Food Lion Shopping Center, in Pittsboro near the urgent care. Call the CEC at 919-704-8669 to confirm hours and/or get directions, or visit the website at ccdpnc.org. \n\nIt's most convenient if you have an SUV or a truck to transport the materials, but a small SUV works well, and a large sedan with trunk space works too.\n\n**2. Set Up Site** - Arrive at the Strawberry Social site at 193 Lorax Lane Street in Pittsboro by 10:30 am on Sunday, May 25, unload all of the equipment, and set up the CCDP tent. \n\n[Download this PDF that tells you everything you need to know about setting up a CCDP tent event!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/166H68VYdekt4POF1CXZYRR0mdMTQy0yN/view?usp=sharing)\n\nTo **join the take-down crew** on Sunday, May 25 at 5 pm: [Sign Up Here](https://www.mobilize.us/chathamcountydems/event/784813/)\n\nTo **take a shift** working at the tent: [Sign Up Here](https://www.mobilize.us/chathamcountydems/event/784795/)",

Main St. 76574\n\nJoin us in Taylor for this nonpartisan demonstration in support of preserving our Democracy-and reclaiming the flag for all Americans!\n\nAs desired/able, please bring your own sign and flag, water, and wear comfortable shoes.  If you'd like to make a sign on site, please come early (9:45), as we will have some materials available.  The plan is to stand on the perimeter of the square and show we care!\n\nSign guidelines:  Signs are most impactful if you use contrasting colors, and the letters are at least 1.5 inches tall, making them readable from 20 Ft. away!\n\nSuggested topics: Anything relating to the constitution , or any domestic programs/policies you are passionate about either protecting and/or speaking out against.\nNational Security( i.e. support NATO, support our Allies)\n\nOur constitutional crisis encompasses many urgent issues, such as  LGBTQIA rights, Immigration, Race, the administration's ridiculous stance on Autism., veterans rights, SS, Medicaid/Medicare. This is not an exhaustive list, by any means.\n\nWe would like to avoid provocative statements about the \"personalities\" involved, profanity, and issues unrelated to the current Constitutional crisis and focus on what's at stake policy-wise, and the impact on humanity. Our goal is to be able to engage with the community in a constructive manner.\nThank you for your understanding and support!\n\nJoin us on Facebook too- look for the group \"Demonstrations for Our Democracy - Taylor, Tx for all current details about this and each demonstration here.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you out there.

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego.

We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

The US Government has detained and deported people without due process or legal justification. \n\nIndivisible Highlands and Beyond, 302 United, and Indivisible Newark First State demand that Avelo Airlines changes course immediately!!\n\nBring signs! We will have some to share, but we urge you to continue making your own great/creative signs! \n\nWe'll rally on both sides of Rt. 13, so stay on whichever side of the highway you park on. Please do NOT cross the busy highway!\n\nParking Options:\n\nGo to Lot D, $7.00 per car, then walk to the nearby sidewalk along the DuPont Hwy. (The first section of Lot D is a quick right turn after passing the ChristianaCare-GoHealth Urgent Care, right next to the Wilmington Airport.The second section of Lot D is a right turn immediately after you past this first turn for lot D.  There is a sign for Lot D at this turn.)\n\nYou can create an account online ahead of time so you can complete your payment from home in advance.  We recommend taking this step ahead of time, so you can just park and join us. Go to this link to set up your parking account: https://p-123.com/. Click on the ‘create your account now’ button. You will be asked for the zone ID which is 10500. You will add your license plate number, then pay with a credit card. \nYou could also use this same link or a QR code once you arrive to pay.  The signs in the parking lot have this info.\nAt this link below you can see where Lot D (or Remote lot) is located:\nhttps://www.flyilg.com/parking-wilmington-airport-ilg\n\nParking is also available behind the IHOP across the street: specifically, try the large shopping area lot between IHOP and Planet Fitness. (Again, if you park there, stay on that side of the road to rally along DuPont Hwy in front of the IHOP. Do NOT cross DuPont Hwy.)",

Lawmakers could revive the bill as early as January 2026 without fixing the real issues: underfunded classrooms, crumbling buildings, and staff shortages. Instead of investing in solutions, they’re setting the stage for more privatization and voucher schemes that threaten public education.\n\nThis takeover attempt was never about helping kids; it was a distraction from decades of disinvestment.\n\nNow it’s time to shape the future of MSCS together. Join Save Our Students (SOS) for a community listening session as we move into the next phase of building stronger, safer schools.\n\nRefreshments will be provided.",

Eventually, we will be going to this farm weekly on Wednesday mornings, but are starting  with this one shift of harvesting radishes.  \n\nPlease remember that all gleaners  must register to get a spot. (Please, do not simply show up at the farm if you have not registered. We can only accommodate registered volunteers.)\n\nGleaning involves harvesting food that will not go to market, but is still good food. We then get it distributed right away to a local hunger relief recipient.\n\nThe work will happen in the farm's field in a variety of weather. It *will* involve bending/stooping at this event, some heavy lifting, and generally getting - at least a little - dirty. This will vary each time.\n\nRegistered volunteers will receive specific instructions about where to meet at the farm.",

    "description": "Join Champlain Valley Indivisible for a family-friendly rally in support of our libraries and museums on Friday, May 9 in Shelburne. 3:00pm - 5:30pm. Meet in front of the Shelburne town office building and we’ll spread out from there along Shelburne Road. Stop by for a few minutes or join us for a few hours!\n\nIn March, President Trump issued an Executive order directing the dismantling of the the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), as well as six other agencies. The announcement also orders the Office of Management and Budget to reject any budget requests from IMLS (and the other six named agencies) other than funds needed to shut down the agency. This week, Trump released his 2026 budget proposal, which calls for the wholesale elimination of the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, as well as several other federal and regional cultural agencies.\n\nWe believe Culture Counts, that it's important to preserve art and history and literature, among other things, and we want to support our local libraries and museums as much as possible. Saturday, May 10 is opening day for Shelburne Museum, so we are gathering in support of the museum and library on Friday, May 9. Please join your friends and neighbors for this peaceful rally - let’s show our library and museum how essential they are to our community! \n\n***Please do not park at the Pierson Library. Look for other parking in town.",

The event is FREE! But donations to Kelly Cheatle's campaign are encouraged at the party! Also my (soon-to-be) famous G.O.A.T-meal cookies* will be available to sample and purchase for $5 at the event and all proceeds will go to Kelly's campaign! \n \nLet your kids and political imagination run wild in a room full of balloons. And in addition enjoy some top-notch pizza, lemonade, chocolate chip cookies, and artisan beers with candidate Kelly and friends!\n\nHosted by Rajesh & Erica Barnabas along with Jeanne Strazzabosco\n\n*G.O.A.T.-meal cookies stand for \"Greatest of All Time\" (oatmeal cookies).",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

Now the cuts are here — and the stakes couldn’t be higher.\n\nBy early May, Congress will have voted on devastating federal budget cuts that could strip away healthcare, food assistance, public education funding, and child care from millions of working families across California. If implemented, these cuts would impact more than 15 million Californians — while giving billionaires tax breaks in one of the largest wealth transfers in U.S. history.\n\nWe refuse to be silent.\n\nJoin us on Wednesday, May 13th from 6:30PM-8:00pm for a We Are California Federal Budget Teach-In. We’ll share urgent updates on these sweeping cuts and coordinate how we fight back — together. This is about defending our communities, our dignity, and our future.\n\n🛑 Hands Off Our Healthcare\n🗣 You come for one of us, you come for all of us\n✊🏽 We Are California — and we fight for all of us\n\nAll hands on deck.

NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",

    "description": "From coast to coast, protests are clearly working!  A recent poll shows that 56% of independents (our target market!) believe “Trump is a dangerous dictator whose power should be limited.”  We’re glad they agree with us!\n\nYet Republicans continue to bend the knee to Trump, with efforts to pass his “big beautiful budget.” \n\nWe believe his budget is toxic and will create devastating consequences for all of us, especially children, the elderly and veterans.  So why do Republicans want it?  To give more tax cuts to the rich!\n\nWe are fighting back with another protest!\n\nTHEME:  TRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET \n\nWHEN: Friday, May 23rd, 3 to 4 pm\n\nWHERE: 32051 Camino Capistrano, SJC (Intersection of Camino Capistrano and Del Obispo.  Please meet near Ross Dress for Less.)\n\nResearch proves that protests are only effective when they have a focused message. Please focus all signs on TRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET.  For example:\n\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET KICKS GRANDMA OUT OF HER NURSING HOME!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET CUTS CANCER RESEARCH!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET BETRAYS THE ELDERLY!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET CUTS FOOD BANK $$$!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET CUTS EDUCATION!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET BENEFITS BILLIONAIRES—NOT YOU!\n•\tTRUMP’S TOXIC BUDGET BETRAYS VETS!\n\nWe’re not trying to limit free speech, we’re strategizing for maximum impact, so please stay on message.\n\nWe had over 2,000 people at our last protest. We can have 4,000 at this one if you bring just one friend!\n\nAs Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said, “These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace…Are you ready for the fight?”\n\nWe are!\n\nAnn & Darcie, Co-chairs\nDWSOC Rapid Response Team",

    "description": "Join friends and neighbors during rush hour, to show our fellow citizens that we're standing up for democracy, standing up for the Constitution, and standing against the Trump Administration's chaos and lawlessness. \n\nBring a sign or a flag, bring a cowbell or whistle, and bring a friend. This is a highly visible spot, with thousands of cars per hour. Our weekly presence gives hope and inspiration to passers by who have not yet resolved to take action. And everyone who attends draws fresh energy from one another and from the community response. \n\nAll participants share the responsibility to keep this gathering safe and peaceful. Use the lights to cross Shelburne Rd; don't engage in negative exchanges with passing drivers, and stay on public property. This is a peaceful demonstration that falls under our First Amendment rights to public assembly and freedom of speech. \n\nParking: Head west on Hannaford Drive. Make a left onto Fayette Road (just before Lowe's). There's plenty of parking on both sides of the road.",

The organization offers a safe space for survivors to share their experiences and connect with others who have faced similar trauma, fostering healing through shared understanding and connection.\n\nhttps://www.conversionsurvivor.org\n\nCurtis Lopez-Galloway (Founder & President) - Palm Springs, CA - grew up in a small town in Southern Illinois. When he was 16 years old he was subjected to conversion therapy; an experience he was later able to use to ban conversion therapy in his home State. Curtis went on to be a leading figure in many LGBTQ+ organizations in the Midwest. Now living in California, Curtis has taken his activism to the next level and founded the Conversion Therapy Survivor Network to bring survivors of conversion therapy together in community and solidarity. In his free time, Curtis likes to try new food, hike nature trails, explore new places, and enjoy nights on the couch.\n\nSamuel Nieves (Board Director) - Tacoma, WA - a dynamic advocate and dedicated supporter of Survivors, is known for his vocal opposition to conversion therapy. He actively engages with social media, sharing insights, holding practitioners accountable, and openly discussing his own experiences with conversion therapy. Hailing from a Mexican American background and raised in Provo, Utah, Samuel pursued a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, which he successfully obtained in 2019. Subsequently, he embarked on a journey in marriage and family therapy. While he ultimately left the therapy field, Samuel continues to play a pivotal role by facilitating weekly community meetings and providing much-needed support.\n\nPARKING UPDATE: There is Ybor Parking Lot #3 directly behind the 1920 Ybor, across the street at the intersection of 6th Ave. and 20th St. The first two hours of parking are free!",

    "description": "The current administration has been actively targeting programs that affect women's health, family life and family economics. They are threatening to interfere with the implementation of the Pregnant Worker's Fairness Act, to limit the enforcement of the freedom of access to abortion clinic entrances (FACE) act and preventing the use federal money to fund or support abortions. 47 has signed an executive order, ordering the evaluation of all pending proceedings under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), which was first passed in 1974 and amended in 1976 to prevent lenders from discriminating against women based on marital status. The administration is also making cuts to programs that affect Women's Healthcare especially in areas considered healthcare deserts including the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOn Saturday, May 10th we will have a march and Family Fun Day in Tucker, GA to show our support for moms. The event will be at the City of Tucker's Church St Park.

On this same day, there is a Juneteenth event at Esther Short Park from 10am-3pm and there is a Pride Block Party on 7th between Main & Washington from 12-7pm and we want people to be able to support these events as well as protest with us on this day.  \n\n\n**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

They are threatening to interfere with the implementation of the Pregnant Worker's Fairness Act, to limit the enforcement of the freedom of access to abortion clinic entrances (FACE) act and preventing the use federal money to fund or support abortions. 47 has signed an executive order, ordering the evaluation of all pending proceedings under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), which was first passed in 1974 and amended in 1976 to prevent lenders from discriminating against women based on marital status. The administration is also making cuts to programs that affect Women's Healthcare especially in areas considered healthcare deserts including the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOn Saturday, May 10th we will have a march and Family Fund Day in Tucker, GA to show our support for moms who have been affected by the policies of the current administration. The event will be at the City of Tucker's Church Steet Park. The park can be seen from LaVista Rd. and is the same park where the city has the Movie on the Green event each month during the spring and summer months.",

    "description": "Edge of Appalachia Ohio Indivisible is partnering with Women’s March for this Nationwide creative action protest! 👏🏼🎪🎡🎠🤡\n\n“When you elect clowns, they don’t become leaders. The country becomes a circus.\n\nOn June 14, Donald Trump will honor himself with a four-mile military parade in our nation’s capitol. Trump’s tacky parade was inspired by dictators he idolizes, and will cost taxpayers nearly $100 million. \n\nOrganizer and strategist Daniel Hunter has written that “Humor is important for our psyches — and to take fascists down a notch[…] Humor is key for morale and exposing the vulnerability of the strongman image.” This is where the ridiculous meets the resistance—and where the future is on the line.\n\nJune 14 is our chance to reflect the absurdity of the MAGA regime and the clowns who lead it. To meet this moment, Women’s March will host community circuses nationwide—bold, creative actions that mirror the chaos MAGA has sown across the country. Together, we’ll set a national record for the most circuses held in a single day while we simultaneously refuse to celebrate a petty clown who desperately wants to be seen as strong. We won’t stop until we build the country we all deserve.\n`\nOur grassroots street circuses turn satire into resistance and reclaim the big tent for democracy.”\n\nWho’s ready to participate in a circus theme protest?!🤡🎪🎡🤹🏼‍♀️🎠\n\nWe need creatives, musicians visual art presenters, A JUGGLER, etc. If you have any circus decorations already we could borrow or find any thrifting we’d love to borrow! We’ll also be looking for a popcorn machine.\n\nWe’ll be reaching out to the city of Hillsboro to see what it takes to shut down a whole road or intersection.👏🏼\n\n#KickOutTheClowns\n#GreatestShitshowOnEarth\n#CommunitiesNotClowns\n#ClownsAgainstClowns \n#BigTentResistance",

Snacks and waters are provided there too as well as informational sheet about our fundraising efforts.\n\nCarpooling options will be available! We want you to be able to get there.\n\nWe are still looking for volunteers to join our security crew, if this is something you think you would be interested in please reach out. We are also coming up with a donation drive to help support our communities.\n\n***More details on the agenda for the day coming soon.\n\nRemember what we are focused on. Do not let agitators or aggressors get a negative rise out of us, they are only distracting us from our goal, our movement. If we are approached by such folks we will step back and chant protect the constitution and this is what community looks like.\n\nThere are 2 free public parking lots near the meeting location, 3 and 5 minute walks as well as 2 hour parking directly in front of where we will be. Please stay as long as you possibly can if not the whole protest time. We need as many there as we can for the entire time. Local media also likes to pop in and out and we want to make sure they see us in our entirety!\n\nAt our first rally we had 7 folks, our 2nd 30 folks and our third 150 folks! Let’s see how many of us we can get out there on May 1st. SAVE THE DATE and make sure to spread the word! Hope to see you there.👏🏼",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

Somebody ought to say something … Somebody gotta challenge this budget.”\n\nWe are holding \"Moral Monday\" street rallies to voice our challenges.\n\nWe oppose Republican-approved Congressional budget resolutions that harm the poorest and most vulnerable of Americans in order to give more than $5-trillion in tax breaks to the richest and most privileged of Americans.\n\nWe oppose Trump/Musk budget proposals that eliminate or make draconian cuts to federal programs for child care, health research, education, housing assistance, community development, and the elderly.\n\nThese funding cuts and proposed budgets are not just public policy choices, they are moral choices. \n\nThese funding cuts and proposed budgets are morally wrong, not just bad public policy choices. \n\nPlease join with us to \"say something\" and \"challenge this budget\".",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",
