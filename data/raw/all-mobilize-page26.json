    "description": "Join us for a relaxed and energizing evening to meet your local field organizer for Abigail Spanberger’s campaign for Governor!\n\nWhether you're a seasoned volunteer or just curious about how to get involved, this is your chance to connect with the organizer leading the charge right here in Suffolk and Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District: Carrington Sneed.\n\nCarrington is a decade-long organizer who got their start on both Bernie Sanders’ and Hillary Clinton’s campaigns at just 11 years old. Since then, they’ve worked in Congress for Rep. Jasmine Crockett, managed Kamala Harris' campaign in Milwaukee, and became the youngest Texan elected to both the DNC and the Electoral College. Now, they bring that experience and passion to Virginia.\n\nWe’ll chat about:\n\n- Why this race really matters\n- What organizing looks like on the ground\n- How you can plug in, no matter your schedule or experience\n- And yes, there will be vibes, stories, and probably a few jokes at Elon Musk’s expense\n\nCome for the strategy, stay for the community. Let’s build something together.\n\n- Date: 05/14/25 @ 6 PM\n- Location: Knotts Coffee Company, 1500 Bridgeport Way Suite 110, Suffolk, VA 23435\n- Questions? Text (682) 347-5402",

If you have a boombox or noise makers, please bring them. \n\nThere is space for 50 vehicles to park, please arrive a half hour or earlier before the start time to allow for safe parking.

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "This June 14th, stand with us at the steps of the North Carolina State Capitol for No Kings Day—a nonpartisan, peaceful rally in defense of the American principles we all hold dear: democracy, accountability, and the rule of law.\n\nAcross the political spectrum, more and more Americans are feeling disillusioned by leaders who put themselves above the people. This day is for anyone who believes that no one—no matter how powerful—should be treated like royalty in a nation built on liberty.\n\nWe’re gathering not in anger, but in unity. This is a space for reflection, connection, and a shared commitment to a country where leaders serve, not rule. Whether you're conservative, progressive, independent, or politically unsure—if you believe in the idea of a government by and for the people, this rally is for you.\n\nThis is a peaceful, de-escalation-focused event. There is no place here for violence, intimidation, or hate. We welcome calm, respectful voices who want to help shape a future rooted in mutual respect and civic responsibility.\n\nBring your signs, your friends, your conscience—and your belief that the United States was never meant to have kings.",

    "description": "# On June 6th, 2025, the Anniversary of D-Day, Mass 50501 will hold an event in remembrance of our heroes in uniform, past and present.\n\nOur mission is the preservation of the democracy that they fought—and in some cases died—to protect on the shores of Europe. We will feature speakers who are themselves veterans, who will speak on history, duty, honor, sacrifice, and patriotism. We will conduct a wreath-laying ceremony at the Soldiers and Sailors Monument on the Boston Common featuring patriotic renditions of “Taps,” “Battle Hymn of the Republic,” and other songs. We will protest cuts to the VA, oppose the undemocratic way in which the administration has treated its duties, reaffirm our support for our allies, and recommit ourselves to the principles that have governed the nation and its military for centuries, and we will remind the people that veterans and active duty military personnel exist to protect the nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic. It will be both a protest and a solemn event of remembrance. \n\n## Event Program\n\n## Act 1: Invocation of Service\nAn honor guard procession will bear American, State, and Service flags from the Soldiers and Sailors Monument to the stage, followed by an invocation and remarks from the Program Director. \n\n## Act 2: The Citizen Soldier\nWe'll hear from ordinary citizens—veterans and those who support them—addressing the issues that matter to veterans today.\n\n## Act 3: A Call to Duty\nVIP speakers will offer stories to help draw us together, and remind us that the bonds of service do not end upon separation from the military and that participation in our democracy is essential to its health and prosperity.\n\n## Act 4: Honor the Fallen\nThe honor guard and key speakers will process back to the Soldiers and Sailors Monument to lay a wreath, followed by Taps, a moment of silence, and closing words. \n\n# Flags are welcome, but please leave protest signs at home.",

    "description": "Placer Women Democrats are joining The Women's March for the June 14 Rally!\n\nWhen you elect clowns, they don’t become leaders. The country becomes a circus. 🤡\n\nOn June 14, Donald Trump will honor himself with a four-mile military parade in our nation’s capitol. Trump’s tacky parade was inspired by dictators he idolizes, and will cost taxpayers nearly $100 million. \n\nOrganizer and strategist Daniel Hunter has written that “Humor is important for our psyches — and to take fascists down a notch[…] Humor is key for morale and exposing the vulnerability of the strongman image.” This is where the ridiculous meets the resistance—and where the future is on the line.\n\nJune 14 is our chance to reflect the absurdity of the MAGA regime and the clowns who lead it. To meet this moment, Women’s March will host community circuses nationwide—bold, creative actions that mirror the chaos MAGA has sown across the country. Together, we’ll set a national record for the most circuses held in a single day while we simultaneously refuse to celebrate a petty clown who desperately wants to be seen as strong. We won’t stop until we build the country we all deserve.\n`\nOur grassroots street circuses turn satire into resistance and reclaim the big tent for democracy.\n\n#KickOutTheClowns\n#GreatestShitshowOnEarth\n#CommunitiesNotClowns\n#ClownsAgainstClowns \n#BigTentResistance",

    "description": "Join us for a social speaker series dedicated to learning about Rhode Island government in a friendly, casual environment. Come meet other civic-curious people, and walk away with a tool box of direct actions you can take to make meaningful change in your local community. And maybe make some new friends! \n\nThis event will focus specifically on state, city and town budgets. Expert speakers will present an overview of how a budget is drafted, approved and implemented. They will also discuss specific actions non-elected citizens can take to participate in the process and influence the money that flows back into their communities. Future monthly Rhody Civics Club events will focus on topics such as an overview of the state legislature, how a bill becomes law, housing justice, and how to run an election, among others. \n\nSmall bites will be provided, as well as a full self-pay bar. This event is open to under 21, and the bar will be checking ID. Spend some time chatting with other attendees and building new connections, before transitioning to listening to the expert speakers. There will be a Q&A session at the end. \n\nAll are welcome! Anyone interested in getting more involved in our government is invited. Together we can make democracy what it was always supposed to be: of the people, by the people, for the people.\n\nThis event is sponsored by the Rhode Island Working Families Party.",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We’ll discuss the fight to defend healthcare access at the federal level, including Medicaid and SNAP, and how Illinois can lead the way with innovative solutions.\n\nWe’ll focus on HB 1443/SB 66, a proposal to create a Prescription Drug Affordability Board (PDAB) in Illinois. This board would address skyrocketing prescription drug costs by evaluating high-cost medications and setting Upper Payment Limits (UPLs) to protect consumers. \n\nTogether, we can make Illinois a model for affordable, accessible healthcare. Don’t miss this chance to learn more about the challenges we face, the solutions we’re advancing, and how you can join the movement for affordable healthcare. Register now to secure your spot!",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re joining our allies nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.\n\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings. NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.\n\nPARKING INFO:\n\nYou can park in the lot behind City Hall. Parking is also available at the below locations. All are within easy walking distance from City Hall, and there’s a street light to facilitate crossing the street:\n\n•\tAlong Lohmann St.\n•\tThe small parking lot on the corner of Main St and Johns Rd (across Johns Rd from St Helena Church)\n•\tThe parking lot off Lohmann St, just behind the Boerne Visitors Center",

This campaign seeks to codify access to gender affirming care, reproductive healthcare, and marriage equality into the Oregon constitution. \n\nER4A gives Oregon voters a chance to enshrine these values. We need to gather over 250,000 signatures to get on the ballot in 2026. Joining us at pride this year is a chance to celebrate and advocate for a better Oregon.\n\nWe will be collecting signatures, sharing our work, and giving away goodies to all who stop by our booth. \n\nWe hope you'll join us!

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

This isn’t just about donations — it’s about showing who we are: neighbors who step up and take care of each other.\n\nWhat Stephanie stands for:\n\n✅ Stopping Reckless Growth\n\n✅ Preparing for Disasters\n\n✅ Improving Commutes\n\n✅ Strengthening Schools\n\n✅ Establishing Term Limits\n\n✅ Uniting Pasco to Move Forward Together\n\nBring a bag of nonperishables, apples, carrots, diabetic-friendly snacks, or shelf-stable proteins like tuna. Every item helps, and every voice matters.\n\nYou’ll hear from Stephanie and local leaders, add your ideas to the “How Can We Improve Pasco?” vision board, and leave with campaign swag and a clear call: It’s time for a Pasco that works for the people.",

    "description": "🗓️ June 14, 2025\n🕐 1:00–4:00 PM\n📍 17th Street NW Bridge, over Atlanta highways (near Atlantic Station)\n\nOn June 14th, while Donald Trump attempts to display military power meant to silence dissent, we will rise above the noise—literally and symbolically.\n\nNo Cake for False Kings is a high-visibility, nonviolent protest that will take place on the 17th Street NW pedestrian bridge, which crosses over ALL of Atlanta’s busiest highways. We are joining activists across America to send one unified message: we reject authoritarianism, abuse of power, and the erasure of our rights.\n\nThis is not a celebration. This is a warning.\nThere will be no cake, no crowns, and no complicity.\n\n🔥 What to Expect:\n- A powerful visual presence over the highway with large protest banners\n\n- Protesters lining both sides of the bridge sidewalks to reach drivers below and pedestrians around\n\n- Organized chants, signs, and nonviolent resistance\n\n- An Information & Resource Table with know-your-rights guides, activist materials, and ways to plug in\n\n- A Water & Cooling Station to ensure safety in the heat\n\n** Participants are strongly encouraged to WEAR RED as a unified symbol of protest and defiance. \n\n🎒What to bring: \n- For those wanting to avoid the summer sun, having an umbrella to provide shade is encouraged. \n\n- Wear a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen to protect from the sun!\n\n- Water, water, water! We will have a water station as well as cooling towels and packs, but these are limited, so bring water for yourself and your group if possible.\n\n- Signs and flags are strongly encouraged, but organizers will have extras for those in need *limited, first come first serve \n\n- Foldable chair: for those needing a break from standing for long periods of time\n\n-Snacks: protesting takes energy, so bring some snacks to refuel! \n\n\n🧭 Getting There:\n-Parking is available at Atlantic Station just steps away from the bridge\n\n- For those using public transit, MARTA’s Arts Center Station is the closest stop and offers a shuttle to Atlantic Station\n\nThis protest is about visibility and truth. We must be loud, proud, and impossible to ignore. Bring your voice, your signs, and your conviction.\n\nTogether, we will show this country that we do not bow to tyrants—we rise up against them.",

    "description": "(Indivisible Tompkins is hosting this event. Register now and check your email for important updates and event details!)\n**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

Pick-Up Equipment** - Sometime **the week of June 2 - June 6,** pick up the tent, table, chairs, and other equipment from CCDP's office in the Food Lion Shopping Center, in Pittsboro near the urgent care. Call the CEC at 919-704-8669 to confirm hours and/or get directions, or visit the website at ccdpnc.org. \n\nIt's most convenient if you have an SUV or a truck to transport the materials, but a small SUV works well, and a large sedan with trunk space works too.\n\n**2. Set Up Site** - Arrive at the Pride Festival site at 193 Lorax Lane Street in Pittsboro by 9:30 am on Saturday, June 7, unload all of the equipment, and set up the CCDP tent. \n\n[Download this PDF that tells you everything you need to know about setting up a CCDP tent event!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FaITqN0bn4Cw_-pORJLPsTR23YTnJDH0/view?usp=sharing)\n\nTo **join the take-down crew** on Saturday, June 7 at 5 pm: [Sign Up Here](https://www.mobilize.us/chathamcountydems/event/786631/)\n\nTo **take a shift** working at the tent: [Sign Up Here](https://www.mobilize.us/chathamcountydems/event/786627/)",

    "description": "As House and Senate Republicans advance a federal budget that proposes $1.5 trillion in cuts to vital programs like Medicaid, Republican seniors and community leaders in Pennsylvania are speaking out. Join the Pennsylvania Alliance for Retired Americans (PARA) for a virtual roundtable highlighting the voices of Republican voters who reject these devastating cuts and support preserving Medicaid for their families and communities.\n\nMedicaid is a lifeline for over 400,000 seniors in Pennsylvania and supports 5 out of every 8 nursing home residents. While congressional Republicans push for cuts, polling shows that most Republican voters—including Trump supporters—oppose slashing Medicaid and understand its critical role in local health care systems.\n\nThis event will feature testimony from Republican retirees, caregivers, and advocates calling on lawmakers to protect Medicaid. Together, we’ll make clear that the fight to save Medicaid is not a partisan issue—it’s a moral one.\n\nWho Should Attend:\nCommunity members, advocates, media, and anyone concerned about the future of health care and retirement security in Pennsylvania.",

    "description": "By popular demand, Katy Indivisible is hosting an organizing workshop, in collaboration with Fort Bend First PAC and Fort Bend’s Indivisible No Surrender Coalition.\n\nWe are excited to have two of Texas’ (and US’) best organizers at this workshop: Delilah Agho-Otoghile (Hillary Clinton’s and Beto’s Presidential Campaigns as well as Stacey Abrams’ Senate campaign) and Jay Malone (former Political Director Gulf Coast AFL-CIO and a founder member of Movement Workers United IUPAT Local 2030).\n\nBackground:  We’re seeing a massive rise in people seeking opportunities to fight against the authoritarian threat experienced in US as a whole and Texas in particular. Currently the biggest bottleneck to leveraging this force is the shortage of organizers.\n \nAim: Train experienced organizers to bring their skills to the next level. And to transform engaged members of the community into organizers.\n \nTarget participants: Community members interested in becoming organizers or improving their organizing skills: precinct chairs, organizers of protests, people active in liberal organizations, volunteer organizers on campaigns, VDVRs, etc.\n\nAfter the workshop in the library we will apply our skills and go canvassing. So have good shoes and download / update Minivan app in advance.",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "In America, we don’t put up with wanna-be kings!\n\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\nOn Saturday, June 14, Americans are taking to the streets nationwide. \n\nIn El Dorado County, CA, were rising up (literally) in a coordinated, multi-location, mass demonstration!\n\n10 OVERPASSES  • 16 MILES • 1 MESSAGE \n\nJoin us along Route 50 from Cameron Park to Placerville. Choose which overpass or pedestrian bridge you will rise up on to say: NO KINGS RULING OVER US!\n\nThere are 10 different registration links for the locations shown below. This is registration link # 3 for the El Dorado Road Hwy. 50 overpass in Diamond Springs/Placerville near the Snowline Hospice Thrift store.\n\nThe others can also be found on Mobilize. Sign up for the one you’ll go to:\n\n1.  Cameron Park - Cambridge Rd\n2.  Shingle Springs - Ponderosa Rd. \n3.  Diamond Springs/Placerville - EL Dorado Rd. *\n4.  Placerville - Missouri Flat Rd. \n5.  Placerville - Placerville Dr. / Forni Dr. \n6.  Placerville - Ray Lawyer Dr \n7.  Placerville - Pedestrian Bridge West \n8.  Placerville  - Pedestrian Bridge East \n9.  Placerville - Carson Rd \n10.  Almost Apple Hill - El Dorado Trail Pedestrian/Bike Bridge (some hiking or cycling required about .8 mi. from trail parking near 2911 Jacquier Rd).\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Join your friends and neighbors at Sister District Project San Francisco for the #NoKings mass protest and day of defiance!\n\nOn June 14, rise up with millions across the country, on Tr*mp's planned military parade day, to stand in opposition and fight back against the attacks on our freedoms by this jury-determined rapist, twice-impeached, 34-time convicted felon, and January 6 traitor. \n\nLook for the Sister District San Francisco banner in front of 350 McAllister between Larkin & Polk from 10:30 – 11am before we head to the main rally in front of City Hall. \n\nBring signs, wear your SDP t-shirt and caps if you have them (we'll have a few extras). \n\nTogether, let's demand a country that puts our families over billionaires' fortunes—public schools over private profits, healthcare over hedge funds, prosperity over the profits of price-gouging and climate polluting corporations.\n\n_A core principle behind all #NoKings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values._\n\nTo learn more about this national day of action, visit [nokings.org](https://www.nokings.org/)\n\nTo learn more about Sister District Project, visit [SisterDistrict.com](https://sisterdistrict.com/strategy).\n\nSince 2016, Sister District Project has been building enduring progressive power in the states to improve people's lives, including by supporting community-based organizations led by people of color on the ground, like [New Virginia Majority](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/sd016-va-nvmef-sf), who do critical grassroots work year round.\n\nYou are welcome to join any of our monthly meetings, whichever is most convenient for you! \n\nWe host events on **Zoom the first Tuesday** of each month; in-person **Happy Hours on the first Thursdays** of even-numbered months; in-person **Coffee Hours on first Thursdays** of odd-numbered months (locations vary); or in-person **Postcard events** on third Sundays or Mondays.",

    "description": "The Fight Against Fascism Organization (FAFO) was founded out of urgency and conviction—a conversation between a combat veteran and a public education advocate who could no longer ignore the direction this country was heading.\nWe watched as veterans’ sacrifices were erased from public memory. At the same time, the very system built to care for them—the Department of Veterans Affairs—was being gutted. More than 80,000 VA employees, many of them veterans themselves, are being laid off in a sweeping federal downsizing. These cuts are already leading to canceled appointments, overwhelmed facilities, and a growing sense of abandonment among those who served.\n\nWe saw teachers blocked from teaching truths. We saw extremism rising—unchecked, unchallenged, and emboldened.\n\nWe knew we couldn’t wait. Something had to change.\n\nFAFO is our answer. We are a veteran-led movement committed to:\n\nHonoring the full legacy of ALL veterans\n\nProtecting VA healthcare and the frontline professionals who make it work\n\nDefending public education rooted in truth—not political convenience\n\nAnd standing firm against the rise of fascism in all forms\n\nOur current organizing efforts are rooted in South Jersey, and we’re expanding across all of New Jersey and the tri-state area (PA, DE, NY). But this movement is open to everyone—no matter what state you live in. If you share our values and want to help carry this mission forward, we would love to have your voice at the table.\n\nIf you believe in truth, justice, and protecting those who served, now is the time to step up.",

    "description": "We are women. We are mothers, daughters, sisters, caregivers, and citizens who care deeply about our country and the people it serves. Today, we’re coming together to send a powerful, heartfelt message to the Republican women in Congress—Senators and Representatives who have remained silent as the rights, safety, and well-being of everyday Americans are stripped away.\n\nWe’ve already written the letter. Now, we need you to help us send it. By lending your name and voice, you’re helping remind these elected leaders of the responsibility they carry—not just as politicians, but as women entrusted with the power to protect lives and stand up to cruelty, corruption, and cowardice.\n\nThis is more than a letter. It’s a call to conscience.\n\nJoin us in asking: Where is your compassion? Where is your courage? Where is your voice?\n\nTogether, let’s demand they remember who they are—and who they serve.\n\nI am not sure that the Zoom will work, I am having problems. If you can access the Zoom Meeting, I will be available to communicate via email. I will send you a pre-written choice of two letters to send to the Republican women leaders. My email address is \"weunite@oemails.com.\"",
