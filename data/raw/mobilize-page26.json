    "description": "In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings. Join Indivisible Chicago and our partner organizations for a rally and march in downtown Chicago as we come together to say NO KINGS! \n\nThis national day of action and mass mobilization responds to the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\nOn June 14—Flag Day—Donald Trump wants tanks in the street and a made-for-TV display for his birthday. But real power isn’t staged in Washington. It rises up everywhere else. And, the flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us.  \n\nNo Kings is a nationwide day of defiance. We’re taking action to reject authoritarianism—and show the world what democracy really looks like.\nOn June 14th, we’re standing together to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.\n\n\nNotices:\n\nA core principle behind this action is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.\n\nIndivisible is managing data and communications with participants. By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support NO KINGS partner organizations.

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "As House and Senate Republicans advance a federal budget that proposes $1.5 trillion in cuts to vital programs like Medicaid, Republican seniors and community leaders in Pennsylvania are speaking out. Join the Pennsylvania Alliance for Retired Americans (PARA) for a virtual roundtable highlighting the voices of Republican voters who reject these devastating cuts and support preserving Medicaid for their families and communities.\n\nMedicaid is a lifeline for over 400,000 seniors in Pennsylvania and supports 5 out of every 8 nursing home residents. While congressional Republicans push for cuts, polling shows that most Republican voters—including Trump supporters—oppose slashing Medicaid and understand its critical role in local health care systems.\n\nThis event will feature testimony from Republican retirees, caregivers, and advocates calling on lawmakers to protect Medicaid. Together, we’ll make clear that the fight to save Medicaid is not a partisan issue—it’s a moral one.\n\nWho Should Attend:\nCommunity members, advocates, media, and anyone concerned about the future of health care and retirement security in Pennsylvania.",

Currently the biggest bottleneck to leveraging this force is the shortage of organizers.\n \nAim: Train experienced organizers to bring their skills to the next level. And to transform engaged members of the community into organizers.\n \nTarget participants: Community members interested in becoming organizers or improving their organizing skills: precinct chairs, organizers of protests, people active in liberal organizations, volunteer organizers on campaigns, VDVRs, etc.\n\nAfter the workshop in the library we will apply our skills and go canvassing. So have good shoes and download / update Minivan app in advance.",

We are joining together as one community, collaborating, coordinating and fighting for our democracy and human rights for EVERYONE. \n\nMultiple area groups are joining together to walk in the parade but we also have something very special planned for everyone to join in together with as part of the entertainment.

We have plenty of planning time, we are so excited to share the special plans with you, please join us! \n\nWorking together with all the groups as well as the amazing PRIDE committee will show the solidarity of the nationwide \"No Kings\" movement while also lifting up our LGBTQIA+ community!!",

    "description": "Donald Trump thinks his rule is absolute, but in America, we don’t do “kings.” Who's Country? OUR COUNTRY!\n\nNO KINGS is a national day of protest in response to the increasing authoritarian rule and corruption from Trump and his puppets. When our elected officials do not listen to us or follow the laws, we must rise up!\n\nWe’ve watched as they’ve tried to take away free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts every step of the way. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies. Now he's going after our Veterans and wants to take away Flag Day.\n\nOn June 14, Flag Day-Trump wants tanks in a military D.C. parade for a made-for-TV display of dominance for his birthday. A spectacle meant to look like strength. But real power isn’t staged in Washington. It rises up from the people.\n\nWe will once again take to our street, June 14. The flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us!\nVeteran's Day belongs to our Veterans!\nThis country belongs to us!\nNo thrones, no crowns, no kings!\n\n#NoKings\n#Ohio50501\n#50501Movement\nNokings.org\n\n\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings and 50501 events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",

We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values._\n\nTo learn more about this national day of action, visit [nokings.org](https://www.nokings.org/)\n\nTo learn more about Sister District Project, visit [SisterDistrict.com](https://sisterdistrict.com/strategy).\n\nSince 2016, Sister District Project has been building enduring progressive power in the states to improve people's lives, including by supporting community-based organizations led by people of color on the ground, like [New Virginia Majority](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/sd016-va-nvmef-sf), who do critical grassroots work year round.\n\nYou are welcome to join any of our monthly meetings, whichever is most convenient for you! \n\nWe host events on **Zoom the first Tuesday** of each month; in-person **Happy Hours on the first Thursdays** of even-numbered months; in-person **Coffee Hours on first Thursdays** of odd-numbered months (locations vary); or in-person **Postcard events** on third Sundays or Mondays.",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "We are women. We are mothers, daughters, sisters, caregivers, and citizens who care deeply about our country and the people it serves. Today, we’re coming together to send a powerful, heartfelt message to the Republican women in Congress—Senators and Representatives who have remained silent as the rights, safety, and well-being of everyday Americans are stripped away.\n\nWe’ve already written the letter. Now, we need you to help us send it. By lending your name and voice, you’re helping remind these elected leaders of the responsibility they carry—not just as politicians, but as women entrusted with the power to protect lives and stand up to cruelty, corruption, and cowardice.\n\nThis is more than a letter. It’s a call to conscience.\n\nJoin us in asking: Where is your compassion? Where is your courage? Where is your voice?\n\nTogether, let’s demand they remember who they are—and who they serve.\n\nI am not sure that the Zoom will work, I am having problems. If you can access the Zoom Meeting, I will be available to communicate via email. I will send you a pre-written choice of two letters to send to the Republican women leaders. My email address is \"weunite@oemails.com.\"",

    "description": "## In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings. ##\n\n### 🤝 On Saturday, June 14, join [OC Indivisible Coalition](https://linktr.ee/ocindivisiblecoalition), [50501 Movement Orange County](https://linktr.ee/50501oc), [Women's March OC](https://www.womensmarch.com/), [WAVE](https://www.wave4all.org/), and other community partners as we gather in solidarity to uphold our Constitution, support our communities and say NO KINGS in America. ###\n\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies and attack our most vulnerable populations.\n\n🇺🇸 The flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\n\nCheck out [nokings.org](https://www.nokings.org/) for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to peaceful, nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*\n\n📢 How to Prepare for **NO KINGS OC**:\n\n✅ Bring signs or props → Make your message visible! (Ideas: “NO KINGS IN AMERICA!”, “THE PEOPLE UNITED”, “NOT YOUR PIGGYBANK!”)\n\n✅ Recruit friends → The more people, the more power.\n\n✅ Record everything → Post photos/videos with #NoKingsOC\n\n\n🚨 We’re fighting for democracy. Let’s make them listen.",

    "description": "To accommodate an expanding interest in our group, we have secured a conference room at the PV Library for this meeting. If turnout is high, we’ll continue our monthly meetings at this location (or at another public venue). \n\nPlease park on Second Street (in front of the Library) and enter the meeting room on the side of the building facing Church Street (across from Jerusalem Lutheran Church). \n\nAGENDA: Our group’s approach is informal. Come join with like-minded people for an evening of sharing and planning! Bring your ideas, your experiences, and your hopes for the future of our country. What have you read about today’s political scene? What have you done to “aid the cause”? If you’re comfortable sharing, please do. Some members just want to be present, which is fine. \nUltimately, we believe that sharing among like-minded people provides comfort to those who may be alone and sparks ideas and activism in others. Let’s share, plan, and act! The goal is to achieve a better future for our children and grandchildren . . .",

    "description": "In 2024 Democrats assumed that our base would turn out in large numbers to support our Democratic candidates. They didn’t. These voters are a very important part of our local, state, and national success.  Our guest, Linda Morales, will explain why we must work to turn out those voters, how we can do that.\n\nLinda Morales stands as one of Texas’s most fearless and visionary advocates for civil rights, a trailblazer whose legacy is etched in the fight for Latino, women’s, LGBTQIA+, and workers' rights. As a fierce union organizer, Morales led campaigns for the National AFL-CIO, SEIU Local 1, Sheet Metal Workers International Union, and California Nurses Association/National Nurses United, organizing workers across industries and empowering them to build collective strength.\n\nHer commitment to social justice also includes a broad range of professional experience in healthcare, government, and labor. She worked as a Legislative Assistant in the Texas Legislature, served as a Television Specialist for the Texas Health Report with Dr “Red” Duke, produced MIDDAY for the Texas Medical Center, and edited What Goes On, a newsletter for healthcare professionals.\n\nCurrently, she continues her work with the Texas Gulf Coast Area Labor Federation/AFL-CIO (TGCALF) and has launched a column titled Raise the Mic, a Facebook space dedicated to speaking out against injustice. Change doesn't happen in silence—it happens when we stand together, amplify each other's voices, and demand better. Raise the Mic is my contribution to that movement, and I hope it inspires others to do the same.\n\n### Invite other Democrats, your friends, and neighbors, to join us!\n\n## 6:30 PM - Social time / order a bite to eat\n\n## 7:00 – 8:30 PM – Program, Club business and announcements",

    "description": "Lauren Boebert refuses to face the people she was elected to represent. Instead, she hides out in Washington, D.C. and cherry-picks appearances in safe, rural corners of the district—dodging real questions and avoiding real accountability. But the people of Colorado’s 4th Congressional District deserve better.\n\nJoin John Padora, a working dad, husband, and manufacturing engineer, for a no-nonsense town hall focused on the issues that matter most to working families. John is running for Congress to give everyday people a voice in D.C.—not billionaires, not political extremists. With two decades of experience on the shop floor, John knows firsthand the struggles families face just trying to get by. He’s traveled across the district with his family, listening, learning, and leading with compassion and grit.\n\nThis is your chance to meet John, hear his vision for a fairer, stronger Colorado, and ask the questions that Boebert refuses to answer. No pre-screened questions. No staged theatrics. Just real conversation.\n\nSpace is limited and registration is required. Light refreshments will be provided.\n\nLet’s stand up for a leader who shows up—and is ready to fight for you.",

    "description": "As part of the Democrats on the Move campaign for May, the SF Democratic Party will be in the Portola/Viz Valley area. As the economy is becoming less predictable, lower income households will be hit hard by rising food costs. That's why we're partnering with Family Connections to help prepare food bags for distribution.\n\nVolunteering will be on Friday, May 9, 11 am - 12 pm at 2565 San Bruno Ave. Check in with Tram, FCC Family Support Coordinator. Wear comfortable shoes. Volunteers will help to assemble bulk produce and pantry items into ~125 bags, which will be distributed to families later that day.\n\nFamily Connections is a nonprofit that operates three family resource centers in the Portola, Excelsior, and Visitacion Valley neighborhoods of San Francisco, serving over 2,200 individuals annually. We provide community-driven, multilingual education and support programs to ensure families can thrive. Our vision is for a connected, equitable community where every child and family can access the resources they need.\n\nFor more info on Family Connections: http://fccenters.org/\n\nFor more info on Democrats on the Move: https://www.sfdems.org/onthemove",

It is much different than the get out of the vote canvassing that we are very used to doing! Deep canvassing is the only scientifically proven method to influence constituents by using empathy and understanding to bridge gaps across differences. It is much more conversational and more about quality over quantity! We are already using it when we knock doors in traditionally ignored parts of Guilford County. We will be joined by seasoned deep canvassers for the training!\n\nSnacks and drinks provided. Please join us",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*\n\nUp to date event information will be available on https://mountainindivisible.org/news/event/no-kings-june-14-2025/ as the events gets closer.",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Join Indivisible Brooklyn's contingent in NYC's No Kings rally.\n\nIn America, we don’t put up with would-be kings. NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",
