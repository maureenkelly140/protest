    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Everyone should have the right to run – and come to the voter as they are. This Pride Month, join us to explore what it means to run for office if you are an LGBTQ+ leader in the making. \n\n  \n\nBeing out and running for office can feel especially challenging right now. But it’s also why this training can be especially important. Acceptance, representation, a voice at the table, and the protection of our rights all work in tandem. Representation is how we got to a Supreme Court decision about marriage equality. More representation, especially at the grassroots level, is how we will get to have and keep more equality – in all ways – the law of the land. \n\n  \n\nAre you a member of the LGBTQ+ community and would you like to run for office? Are you perhaps considering a run for elected office but haven’t yet made the commitment to run or filed your candidacy? Then this virtual live training is for you! \n\n  \n\nJoin our expert trainer and come away with insights and next steps on the following topics:\n\n*   Understanding the steps necessary to run for office\n    \n*   Best practices for choosing which office to run for\n    \n*   Discerning if running is the right decision for you – especially if you are LGBTQ+ and have never run for office but are thinking about it\n    \n*   Identifying what kinds of supports you’ll need to run for office\n    \n*   Preparing for sharing your decision to run with your support network\n    \n\n  \n\nHave accessibility questions?

    "description": "WHAT IS “NO KINGS”?\n\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration. \n\n- We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political positions, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies. They think they rule—but we are bigger than even their worst aspirations.\n\n- Donald Trump is planning a military parade in Washington, D.C. on June 14. This display of might is intended to intimidate opponents and solidify his image as a strongman on our dime—we won’t stand by while that happens.\n\n- Instead of allowing this military parade to be the center of gravity, we will make action everywhere else the story of America that day: people coming together in communities across the country to reject strongman politics and corruption.\n\n- Alongside local organizers, partners, and leaders from across the pro-democracy & pro-worker movement, we will demonstrate organized people power that outpaces any authoritarian aspirations.\n\n* NO KINGS events should be additive and congruent with adjacent mobilizations and recognitions, including Veterans celebrations, Pride events, and Juneteenth on 6/19.",

For the first time, Armored tanks, military vehicles, aircraft and troops are readying for a parade in our nation’s capital in a sickening, fascistic display of fealty to the orange leader. The United States of America has no king! \n\nWe say, HELL NO to Project 2025, Christian Nationalism and authoritarianism! We do not suckle at his needy Orange teet, we will not fall in line! We do not obey!\n\nDate: Saturday, June 14th;\nTime: 4 - 5pm\nLocation: The Queen Ka’ahumanu Hwy, south of Henry street, behind the Mormon temple site (makai side of road)\n\nPlease bring a sign and water.\n\nWe will have about 60 signs to borrow for the event. I you have a drone please take photos and videos. If you have a boombox or noise makers, please bring them. \n\nThere is space for 50 vehicles to park, please arrive a half hour or earlier before the start time to allow for safe parking. There will be orange pylon cones and a flagger during the protest to allow for safe parking during the event as well.\n\nPlease do not stand, park or cross from the mauka (mountain) side of the road. The police have asked this one thing of us.",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

This day is for anyone who believes that no one—no matter how powerful—should be treated like royalty in a nation built on liberty.\n\nWe’re gathering not in anger, but in unity. This is a space for reflection, connection, and a shared commitment to a country where leaders serve, not rule. Whether you're conservative, progressive, independent, or politically unsure—if you believe in the idea of a government by and for the people, this rally is for you.\n\nThis is a peaceful, de-escalation-focused event. There is no place here for violence, intimidation, or hate. We welcome calm, respectful voices who want to help shape a future rooted in mutual respect and civic responsibility.\n\nBring your signs, your friends, your conscience—and your belief that the United States was never meant to have kings.",

We will feature speakers who are themselves veterans, who will speak on history, duty, honor, sacrifice, and patriotism. We will conduct a wreath-laying ceremony at the Soldiers and Sailors Monument on the Boston Common featuring patriotic renditions of “Taps,” “Battle Hymn of the Republic,” and other songs. We will protest cuts to the VA, oppose the undemocratic way in which the administration has treated its duties, reaffirm our support for our allies, and recommit ourselves to the principles that have governed the nation and its military for centuries, and we will remind the people that veterans and active duty military personnel exist to protect the nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic. It will be both a protest and a solemn event of remembrance. \n\n## Event Program\n\n## Act 1: Invocation of Service\nAn honor guard procession will bear American, State, and Service flags from the Soldiers and Sailors Monument to the stage, followed by an invocation and remarks from the Program Director. \n\n## Act 2: The Citizen Soldier\nWe'll hear from ordinary citizens—veterans and those who support them—addressing the issues that matter to veterans today.\n\n## Act 3: A Call to Duty\nVIP speakers will offer stories to help draw us together, and remind us that the bonds of service do not end upon separation from the military and that participation in our democracy is essential to its health and prosperity.\n\n## Act 4: Honor the Fallen\nThe honor guard and key speakers will process back to the Soldiers and Sailors Monument to lay a wreath, followed by Taps, a moment of silence, and closing words. \n\n# Flags are welcome, but please leave protest signs at home.",

    "description": "Placer Women Democrats are joining The Women's March for the June 14 Rally!\n\nWhen you elect clowns, they don’t become leaders. The country becomes a circus. 🤡\n\nOn June 14, Donald Trump will honor himself with a four-mile military parade in our nation’s capitol. Trump’s tacky parade was inspired by dictators he idolizes, and will cost taxpayers nearly $100 million. \n\nOrganizer and strategist Daniel Hunter has written that “Humor is important for our psyches — and to take fascists down a notch[…] Humor is key for morale and exposing the vulnerability of the strongman image.” This is where the ridiculous meets the resistance—and where the future is on the line.\n\nJune 14 is our chance to reflect the absurdity of the MAGA regime and the clowns who lead it. To meet this moment, Women’s March will host community circuses nationwide—bold, creative actions that mirror the chaos MAGA has sown across the country. Together, we’ll set a national record for the most circuses held in a single day while we simultaneously refuse to celebrate a petty clown who desperately wants to be seen as strong. We won’t stop until we build the country we all deserve.\n`\nOur grassroots street circuses turn satire into resistance and reclaim the big tent for democracy.\n\n#KickOutTheClowns\n#GreatestShitshowOnEarth\n#CommunitiesNotClowns\n#ClownsAgainstClowns \n#BigTentResistance",

    "description": "Join us for a social speaker series dedicated to learning about Rhode Island government in a friendly, casual environment. Come meet other civic-curious people, and walk away with a tool box of direct actions you can take to make meaningful change in your local community. And maybe make some new friends! \n\nThis event will focus specifically on state, city and town budgets. Expert speakers will present an overview of how a budget is drafted, approved and implemented. They will also discuss specific actions non-elected citizens can take to participate in the process and influence the money that flows back into their communities. Future monthly Rhody Civics Club events will focus on topics such as an overview of the state legislature, how a bill becomes law, housing justice, and how to run an election, among others. \n\nSmall bites will be provided, as well as a full self-pay bar. This event is open to under 21, and the bar will be checking ID. Spend some time chatting with other attendees and building new connections, before transitioning to listening to the expert speakers. There will be a Q&A session at the end. \n\nAll are welcome! Anyone interested in getting more involved in our government is invited. Together we can make democracy what it was always supposed to be: of the people, by the people, for the people.\n\nThis event is sponsored by the Rhode Island Working Families Party.",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*\n\nThe schedule and place for this event is not finalized at this time. Please check mobilize.us for any changes or check your email. Bring a friend or two to this event. Expand the action!",

We’ll discuss the fight to defend healthcare access at the federal level, including Medicaid and SNAP, and how Illinois can lead the way with innovative solutions.\n\nWe’ll focus on HB 1443/SB 66, a proposal to create a Prescription Drug Affordability Board (PDAB) in Illinois. This board would address skyrocketing prescription drug costs by evaluating high-cost medications and setting Upper Payment Limits (UPLs) to protect consumers. \n\nTogether, we can make Illinois a model for affordable, accessible healthcare. Don’t miss this chance to learn more about the challenges we face, the solutions we’re advancing, and how you can join the movement for affordable healthcare. Register now to secure your spot!",

    "description": "In Beaver County, we don’t put up with would-be kings.\n\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re joining our allies nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.\n\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings. NO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n🚨On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.🚨\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nOn June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings. Check out nokings.org for more information.\n\nA core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.\n\nPARKING INFO:\n\nYou can park in the lot behind City Hall. Parking is also available at the below locations. All are within easy walking distance from City Hall, and there’s a street light to facilitate crossing the street:\n\n•\tAlong Lohmann St.\n•\tThe small parking lot on the corner of Main St and Johns Rd (across Johns Rd from St Helena Church)\n•\tThe parking lot off Lohmann St, just behind the Boerne Visitors Center",

This campaign seeks to codify access to gender affirming care, reproductive healthcare, and marriage equality into the Oregon constitution. \n\nER4A gives Oregon voters a chance to enshrine these values. We need to gather over 250,000 signatures to get on the ballot in 2026. Joining us at pride this year is a chance to celebrate and advocate for a better Oregon.\n\nWe will be collecting signatures, sharing our work, and giving away goodies to all who stop by our booth. \n\nWe hope you'll join us!

    "description": "🗓️ June 14, 2025\n🕐 1:00–4:00 PM\n📍 17th Street NW Bridge, over Atlanta highways (near Atlantic Station)\n\nOn June 14th, while Donald Trump attempts to display military power meant to silence dissent, we will rise above the noise—literally and symbolically.\n\nNo Cake for False Kings is a high-visibility, nonviolent protest that will take place on the 17th Street NW pedestrian bridge, which crosses over ALL of Atlanta’s busiest highways. We are joining activists across America to send one unified message: we reject authoritarianism, abuse of power, and the erasure of our rights.\n\nThis is not a celebration. This is a warning.\nThere will be no cake, no crowns, and no complicity.\n\n🔥 What to Expect:\n- A powerful visual presence over the highway with large protest banners\n\n- Protesters lining both sides of the bridge sidewalks to reach drivers below and pedestrians around\n\n- Organized chants, signs, and nonviolent resistance\n\n- An Information & Resource Table with know-your-rights guides, activist materials, and ways to plug in\n\n- A Water & Cooling Station to ensure safety in the heat\n\n** Participants are strongly encouraged to WEAR RED as a unified symbol of protest and defiance. \n\n🎒What to bring: \n- For those wanting to avoid the summer sun, having an umbrella to provide shade is encouraged. \n\n- Wear a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen to protect from the sun!\n\n- Water, water, water! We will have a water station as well as cooling towels and packs, but these are limited, so bring water for yourself and your group if possible.\n\n- Signs and flags are strongly encouraged, but organizers will have extras for those in need *limited, first come first serve \n\n- Foldable chair: for those needing a break from standing for long periods of time\n\n-Snacks: protesting takes energy, so bring some snacks to refuel! \n\n\n🧭 Getting There:\n-Parking is available at Atlantic Station just steps away from the bridge\n\n- For those using public transit, MARTA’s Arts Center Station is the closest stop and offers a shuttle to Atlantic Station\n\nThis protest is about visibility and truth. We must be loud, proud, and impossible to ignore. Bring your voice, your signs, and your conviction.\n\nTogether, we will show this country that we do not bow to tyrants—we rise up against them.",

    "description": "Join Basic Rights Oregon (BRO) at Bend Pride 2025! \n\nEvery year, we invite members of our LGBTQ2SIA+ community and allies to join us to table at Pride. \n\nAs we continue to see bans on our bodily autonomy, and bans on our ability to safely exist in public, we are embarking on a ballot measure campaign, Equal Rights for All. This campaign seeks to codify access to gender affirming care, reproductive healthcare, and marriage equality into the Oregon constitution. \n\nER4A gives Oregon voters a chance to enshrine these values. We need to gather over 250,000 signatures to get on the ballot in 2026. Joining us at pride this year is a chance to celebrate and advocate for a better Oregon.\n\nWe will be collecting signatures, sharing our work, and giving away goodies to all who stop by our booth. \n\nWe hope you'll join us!

    "description": "(Indivisible Tompkins is hosting this event. Register now and check your email for important updates and event details!)\n**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "## Set-Up Crew\n\nThis sign-up is **ONLY** for the **SET-UP CREW** for Pride Festival. \n\nSet-Up Includes **TWO PARTS:**\n\n**1. Pick-Up Equipment** - Sometime **the week of June 2 - June 6,** pick up the tent, table, chairs, and other equipment from CCDP's office in the Food Lion Shopping Center, in Pittsboro near the urgent care. Call the CEC at 919-704-8669 to confirm hours and/or get directions, or visit the website at ccdpnc.org. \n\nIt's most convenient if you have an SUV or a truck to transport the materials, but a small SUV works well, and a large sedan with trunk space works too.\n\n**2. Set Up Site** - Arrive at the Pride Festival site at 193 Lorax Lane Street in Pittsboro by 9:30 am on Saturday, June 7, unload all of the equipment, and set up the CCDP tent. \n\n[Download this PDF that tells you everything you need to know about setting up a CCDP tent event!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/166H68VYdekt4POF1CXZYRR0mdMTQy0yN/view?usp=sharing)\n\nTo **join the take-down crew** on Saturday, June 7 at 5 pm: [Sign Up Here](https://www.mobilize.us/chathamcountydems/event/786631/)\n\nTo **take a shift** working at the tent: [Sign Up Here](https://www.mobilize.us/chathamcountydems/event/786627/)",
