As a nation, we recognize-realize that we have work to do in order to reflect our values as a true democracy \"with liberty and justice for all.\"  We acknowledge that academia consistently limits-minimizes and even stifles black scholars, classifying the benefits of their documentation-studies as a form of identity politics or a 'niche' culture.\n\n- - - - -\n\n__Future-Tentative Topics for Reading-Book Collections__\n\n* October-November 2022 - The Paths Forward for Racial Equity and Social Justice\n* November-December 2022 - The Collective Impact of Health Equity and the COVID-19 Vaccine\n* [TBD Month-Day, 2022] - [_submit recommendations for consideration_]\n\n- - - - -\n\n* BANNED-CHALLENGED BOOKS:  Publishers \"Banned-Challenged Books\" [by various authors] [(preview)](https://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/decade2019) [(pdf)](unavailable) ... __(current-consideration book-reading 2022-2023, _date to be determined_).__\n\n* RACIAL EQUITY:  New York Times \"The 1619 Project\" [by Nikole Hannah-Jones] [(preview)](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html) [(pdf)](https://www.pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/full_issue_of_the_1619_project.pdf) ... __(current-consideration book-reading 2022-2023, _date to be determined_).__\n\n* RACIAL EQUITY:  The Atlantic \"The Case for Reparations\" [by Ta-Nehisi Coates] [(preview)](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/) [(pdf)](unavailable) ... __(current-consideration book-reading 2022-2023, _date to be determined_).__\n\n- - - - -\n\n__(review reading-book collections additional details)__\n\nPrivate / MEMBERS' EXCLUSIVE EVENT\n*for* Members of 2020 Victorious! | Communities United ...

The books-readings will be read in chapters-segments (to accommodate-adjust for schedules-time). The chapter-segments would be discussed weekly-monthly for the purposes of long-term education-learning enhancement (to slowly digest-dissect the information).\n\nBENEFITS of Reading Clubs – Listening to Different Perspectives\n\n* Hearing– the opinions of other people is crucial to growing into a well-rounded, developed person.  Reflecting on the thoughts and perspectives of others opens the mind to an entirely new world.\n\n* Learning – how to share your thoughts and opinions, especially if you disagree, teaches communication and social skills.\n\n* Developing – the most from the book club is about listening to other perspectives.\n\nMission-Purpose: The intent is to broaden our knowledge of who-what-where-why we are as Americans in the fullness of our history (as defined by black intelligentsia) and not simply within the limited context of exclusionary American history.\n\n- - - - -\n\nPOTENTIAL BOOK-Publication Discussion Resources:\n\n* COVID-19: Health-Wellness [None yet determined.]\n\nTitle\tPreventable: The Inside Story of How Leadership Failures, Politics, and Selfishness Doomed the U.S. Coronavirus Response, Author Andy Slavitt, Publisher St. Martin's Publishing Group, 2021 ...

At the heart of the book are the humble stories of Americans yearning to be a part of a better America, including white supremacy's collateral victims: white people themselves. With startling empathy, this heartfelt message from a Black woman to a multiracial America leaves us with a vision for the future of our country--one whose population has ties to every place on the globe--where we finally realize that life can be so much more than zero-sum.\" ...

The editors, Ibram X. Kendi and Keisha N. Blain, have assembled ninety brilliant writers, each of whom takes on a five-year period of that four-hundred-year span. The writers explore their periods through a variety of techniques: historical essays, short stories, personal vignettes, and fiery polemics. They approach history from various perspectives: through the eyes of towering historical icons or the untold stories of ordinary people; through places, laws, and objects. While themes of resistance and struggle, of hope and reinvention, course through the book, this collection of diverse pieces from ninety different minds, reflecting ninety different perspectives, fundamentally deconstructs the idea that Africans in America are a monolith—instead it unlocks the startling range of experiences and ideas that have always existed within the community of Blackness.\" [(preview)](https://books.google.com/books/about/Four_Hundred_Souls.html?id=HVj2DwAAQBAJ) ... _(past book-reading May-October 2021)._\n\n* CLIMATE CHANGE:  [None yet determined.]\n\n* POLITICAL POLARIZATION:  Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents\n— \"Shade is a portrait in Presidential contrasts, telling the tale of the Obama and Trump administrations through a series of visual juxtapositions. Here, more than one hundred of Souza's unforgettable images of President Obama deliver new power and meaning when framed by the tweets, news headlines, and quotes that have defined the Trump White House.  What began with Souza's Instagram posts soon after President Trump's inauguration in January 2017 has become a potent commentary on the state of the Presidency, and our country. Some call this \"throwing shade.\" Souza calls it telling the truth.\" ... __(current-interim book-reading November-December 2021).__\n\n- - - - -\n\n[Introductions Checklist: __(updates in-progress, review only)__\n\n– Introduce yourself in our Introductions thread by clicking here.

If you have between two and three hours per week to read, you should be fine.\n\nWill there be any in-person meetings of the reading-book collections?\n\nWhile the 2020VCU Reading-Book Collections is entirely online, regional-state groups will offer opportunities for in-person/online gatherings from time-to-time.

Here, more than one hundred of Souza's unforgettable images of President Obama deliver new power and meaning when framed by the tweets, news headlines, and quotes that have defined the Trump White House.  What began with Souza's Instagram posts soon after President Trump's inauguration in January 2017 has become a potent commentary on the state of the Presidency, and our country. Some call this \"throwing shade.\" Souza calls it telling the truth.\"\n\n* Think Again : The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know by Grant, Adam M., author. — \"This is the right book for right now. Yes, learning requires focus. But, unlearning and relearning requires much more--it requires choosing courage over comfort. The bestselling author examines the critical art of rethinking: learning to question your opinions and open other people's minds, which can position you for excellence at work and wisdom in life. Intelligence is usually seen as the ability to think and learn, but in a rapidly changing world, there's another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn. In our daily lives, too many of us favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt. We listen to opinions that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard. We see disagreement as a threat to our egos, rather than an opportunity to learn. We surround ourselves with people who agree with our conclusions, when we should be gravitating toward those who challenge our thought process.\"\n\n- - - - -\n\nWE BELIEVE IN THE STRENGTH of progressive community organizing – but, it must be protected from the forces that seek to subvert our democracy.  By organizing and working to facilitate the systems that allow for all Americans to have a voice and a vote, we can hold our government accountable to the people and pass-secure comprehensive legislation to ensure that the essentials of comprehensive democratic reform are respected and protected.  This national collaborative will require more than a select few community activists-organizers-volunteers to be long-term and successful.\n\nThere are two competing visions for the United States of America:  one that harnesses-manages grassroots organizing to empower voters and one that unleashes false narratives and rhetoric to justify voter suppression.  In a democracy, only one can prevail.\n\nJOIN US in our community to receive the latest news and information updates to contribute-create a viable community action plan.

San Francisco: Filmmakers Collaborative, 2014. HD, 59 min. [(register)](https://www.mobilize.us/2020victorious/event/394431/) – Monday-Sunday, January-December 00, 2022 8:00pm, TBD *various times* * In order to reach zero waste, we need to change our relationship to garbage and how to view the things we discard as resources, rather than waste. As a resource, our garbage can take on another life, stay out of the landfill, and enter into a cycle that is cradle to cradle, reused and recreated over and over again. Racing to Zero examines today’s cultural garbage practices in terms of consumption, preparation, use and production. Only one third of the waste in the United States is recycled or composted. Why? Industry, through its practice of planned obsolescence, plays a major role; our lives are almost totally dependent on unrecyclable petroleum products.

National Priorities-Proposals Volunteer Call-to-Action | Communities United__\n\n2020 Victorious! | Communities United [(event programs)](https://www.mobilize.us/2020victorious/)\n\nGrassroots:  A grassroots movement is one that uses the people in a given district, region, or community as the basis for a political or economic movement. Grassroots movements and organizations use collective action from the local level to effect change at the local, regional, national, or international level.\n\n- - - - -\n\nCommunity Engagement | Volunteer Leadership - Presentation Request - Important: Review the event program description details *carefully* to confirm-find the corresponding dates-links in the Volunteer Call-to-Action. *Review event details frequently-weekly* for description-schedule updates.*\n\n__This is a volunteer call-to-action__ (review description details below to confirm dates-times and requirements).  Registration descriptions for most-each volunteer opportunity meeting is available, some description details will be made available closer to the scheduled dates. Below is the volunteer meeting schedule for January-March 2022:\n\n- - - - -\n\n__VOLUNTEER CALL-TO-ACTION__ (national-regional)\n\nVirtual Meeting: __White House COVID-19 Update Call__ [(register)]() – Tuesday, October 25, 2022 5:00pm-6:00pm ET * Join Dr. Ashish Jha, White House Coordinator of COVID-19 Response and Counselor to the President; Julie Rodriguez, White House Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and Senior Advisor to the President; and Keisha Lance Bottoms, White House Senior Advisor to the President for Public Engagement for a briefing on the latest with the updated COVID-19 vaccination campaign and the Biden-Harris Administration’s whole of government ongoing fight against the virus.\n\n* * * * *\n\n__FUTURE ANCHOR EVENTS__ (more soon to be posted)\n\nDocumentary: Climate Change | National Priorities - __Racing to Zero: In Pursuit of Zero Waste,__ Beaver, Christopher.  San Francisco: Filmmakers Collaborative, 2014. HD, 59 min. [(register)](https://www.mobilize.us/2020victorious/event/394431/) – Monday-Sunday, January-December 00, 2022 8:00pm, TBD *various times* * In order to reach zero waste, we need to change our relationship to garbage and how to view the things we discard as resources, rather than waste. As a resource, our garbage can take on another life, stay out of the landfill, and enter into a cycle that is cradle to cradle, reused and recreated over and over again. Racing to Zero examines today’s cultural garbage practices in terms of consumption, preparation, use and production. Only one third of the waste in the United States is recycled or composted. Why? Industry, through its practice of planned obsolescence, plays a major role; our lives are almost totally dependent on unrecyclable petroleum products. Three years ago, the mayor of San Francisco pledged to achieve zero waste by 2020. Racing to Zero tracks San Francisco’s waste stream diversion tactics and presents innovative new solutions to waste.

    "description": "Welcome to the biggest fight of our lives. Time to join Field Team 6's free BYOP text team - and text millions of unregistered likely Democrats in key swing states to win 10 key elections in 2025, and more in '26!\n\nWe love free texting! We call it BYOP or Bring Your Own Phone, although it actually uses your own computer, usually with an anonymized Google Voice number. It's a great way to register new Democrats!\n\nThere are a few things you'll need to set up on your computer but they aren't difficult, and we provide all the training you need at our BYOP Boot Camp sessions. If you're tech savvy and want to do the set up on your own, this User Guide provides all the information: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RQeU1Z9YVpnqI0dLFD7CV2HBEgP--R2-OfGITkfd34g/edit?usp=sharing\n\nOnce trained, you'll be able to send texts any time between 9 am – 9 pm in the Time Zone you're texting. We have multiple campaigns available (listed in the document linked above) and you get to choose which one appeals to you.\n\nWe use Slack to communicate with our BYOP-ers. If you already have a login to the Field Team 6 Slack channel, great! If not, we'll give you the sign-up link during the BYOP Boot Camp. (once signed up, look for the #byop-bring_your_own_phone channel.)\n\nSTATES INCLUDED: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin\n\nABOUT FIELD TEAM 6\nField Team 6 is a volunteer army on a simple mission: Register Democrats. Save the World. To win in 2020, we helped register 785,000 Democratic voters in 11 key swing states. In 2022, we brought that total to 2.3 million and defied history, preventing a Red Wave and increasing our Senate majority. We did this by registering women, young people, people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, and every single good-hearted person we could find... and getting them out to vote! Now it’s time to save the world again – so we’re registering new Democrats who can paint the House Blue in '26 and win a Blue Trifecta in '28 to save democracy!",

    "description": "2020 Victorious! | Communities United is conducting a National Voter Mobilization-Education Weeks of Action to get our communities prepared to head #BacktotheBallotBox #VoteReady from __Saturday, September 25, 2021 to Sunday, October 3, 2021__ and #VoterEducation from __Monday-Friday, October 4-8, 2021.__\n\n__5 Days | 5 Actions__ National Voter Education Week (NVEW) helps voters bridge the gap between registering to vote and actually casting a ballot. During this week of interactive education, voters have the opportunity to find their polling location, understand their ballot, make a plan to vote in person or remotely, and more. NVEW strives to help voters overcome common barriers to become confident voters and ambassadors of voting in their own communities for every election.\n\n* Monday: #VoteReady - Register to vote or check your registration status.\n* Tuesday: #MailReady - Request your mail-in ballot.\n* Wednesday: #VotePlanReady - Make a plan to vote.\n* Thursday: #BallotReady - Learn what's on your ballot.\n* Friday: #WeReady - Level up your voting engagement.\n\n2020 Victorious! | Communities United is counting on all of us to participate by registering our colleagues-neighbors, families-friends and communities to ensure that eligible voters check and update their voter registration status during National Voter Mobilization-Education Weeks of Action.  We are calling on you to participate by registering your friends, family, and neighbors, and helping eligible voters check and update their voter registration.\n\nBegin by thinking of several dates and places that you can integrate voter registration into your schedule, including the places that you will already be! Think about the gatherings you already attend, and places where you regularly have conversations with others.  RSVP to this event page to indicate that during the Weeks of Action, you will participate by registering voters in your neighborhood and help your colleagues-neighbors, families-friends and communities check and update their voter registration!\n\nWhile National Voter Mobilization-Education Weeks of Action is a targeted campaign scheduled for a full extended week, the call-to-action can begin today and continue any-every day throughout the year.  We will meet, as a collective, on the designated dates-times above to discuss our daily progress and brainstorm ideas!\n\nA few great places to host voter registration drives include: places of worship (ask to get a table in the lobby after services), the business office workplace (talk to each colleague to get them to update their registration), your high school or college-university (set-up a table in a high-traffic area or talk to fellow students during breakfast-lunch), and high-traffic areas in your community (laundromats, playgrounds, public parks, restaurants, supermarkets), etc.\n\n160 million Americans cast their ballots in 2020 – shattering voter turnout records and making history.  And we can’t stop now.  There is still work to be done before we head #BacktotheBallotBox!\n\nELECTION PROTECTION HOTLINE: Call or Text 866-OUR-VOTE * Tweet @866OURVOTE",

Join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session to learn more about the different ways you can engage. \n\nTeam ENOUGH is a youth-led program whose mission is to educate young voices about gun violence and mobilize them to take meaningful action against it. Supported by Brady United, we harness the expertise and experience of today’s youth to advance our intersectional work across the country. \n\nLed by an Executive Council, comprised of students just like us, we believe that diversity is a strength, and that only when everyone has a seat at the table can we build an effective movement to prevent all gun violence in all communities.\n\nFor us, preventing gun violence not only requires regulating access to firearms but also addressing how systemic racism and environmental factors cause this form of bloodshed to run especially rampant in communities of color. You cannot talk about gun violence without talking about police brutality, white supremacy, the broken criminal justice system, poverty, homophobia, access to affordable housing, or the often barriers separating disadvantaged populations from physical and mental healthcare. \n\nSo if you share this belief, join us for our Team ENOUGH welcome session and become part of the movement to end gun violence in our lifetime.",

They See Blue, WAVE, DVC, Indivisible, Swing Left, Four Directions, Putnam Progressives, Blue Revolution, Together We Elect... The list is way too long to name them all here, but we need to partner with YOU too! \n\nWhy? Because that's how we scale up! That's how we do all the crazy important work of registering new Democrats in swing states, so we can win in 2025, 2026, and 2028 and save our democracy! \n\nWe've built this super-sexy infrastructure, acquired mountains of data, and built a whole new shiny, user-friendly partnership system, so that we can help your organization – for free – to run in-person voter drives, textbanks, postcarding, and social media storms. (If you can raise money, we can also set up paid text banks.)\n\nYou can partner in just one way – or all the ways. And we encourage all our partners to tailor every script to the voice of your audience.\n\nThe end result? Together, we will help register *far* more swing state Democrats.\n\nSo thank you for signing up for our How to Partner with Field Team 6 event! Can't wait to see you there!\n\nP.S. - We partner everywhere! But for those interested...\nCURRENT TARGET STATES INCLUDE: Arizona, California, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin",

    "description": "Black Voters Matters works to increase power in marginalized, predominantly Black communities. And while effective voting is an important way for a community to determine its own destiny, that’s only one way the organization strives to build power. In addition to voting and electoral organizing, Black Voters Matter supports community-based organizations working on a wide range of issues such as mass incarceration, gentrification, health care, education and more.\n\nWe are looking for volunteers who want to join our power building team and make a real impact. Each volunteer opportunity helps to increase voter engagement, supports protecting our right to vote, and\ngets us closer to our goal of building permanent, progressive power in Black communities! Start your power building journey by joining us on Tuesdays at 5pm ET for the volunteer orientation.\n\nYou will learn more about Black Voters Matter, what to expect as a volunteer, and the ways you can volunteer.\n\nInvite friends, family, and colleagues to join you!\n\nPlease note, you only need to attend one volunteer orientation.",

This powerful 45-minute documentary sheds light on the ongoing threats to free and fair elections in the United States and ways that people can help get democracy back on track.\nAmerican democracy is under threat. In recent years, many states have made it harder for people to vote and easier for partisan actors to subvert valid elections. At the same time, the U.S. Supreme Court continues to roll back Americans’ fundamental rights. Extremists at every level of government are doing their best to stop the emergence of a racially and ethnically diverse democracy and block important and popular policies. How did the United States get here, and what can be done?\n\nYou're invited to bring your colleagues-neighbors, family-friends and communities to a 45-minute screening of Suppressed and Sabotaged: The Fight to Vote. [(movie trailer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RhrbEh-osI&t=1s)\n\n2020 Victorious! | Communities United is conducting a National Voter Registration Year of Action to get our communities prepared to head #BacktotheBallotBox from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022.\n\n2020 Victorious! | Communities United is counting on all of us to participate by registering our colleagues-neighbors, families-friends and communities to ensure that eligible voters check and update their voter registration status during the National Voter Registration Year of Action. We are calling on you to participate by registering your friends, family, and neighbors, and helping eligible voters check and update their voter registration.\n\nSaving our democracy has never been led by the people in power – it’s been led by each one of us, and it starts in our communities.\n\n160 million Americans cast their ballots in 2020 – shattering voter turnout records and making history. And we can’t stop now. There is still work to be done before we head #BacktotheBallotBox!\n\nELECTION PROTECTION HOTLINE: Telephone or Text 866-OUR-VOTE (866-687-8683) * Tweet @866OURVOTE",

    "description": "__It is a New Day for America!__  We know exactly what the United States of America stands for, we know what we believe, and what we should do to transform the nation into \"a more perfect union.\"  These are the weeks-months that we, as a nation, prepare to benefit from and reflect upon all the labor towards important causes and well-earned campaign successes. This is going to be a historic election transition season!\n\nJoin us as we criss-cross the nation from New York to California, from Florida to Texas, from Washington, DC to the State of Washington (east-west, north-south) and into the battleground states to support the election-transition successes on Tuesday, November 8, 2022. The plan is to stay alert and to mobilize our colleagues-neighbors, families-friends, and communities in order to support __the national issues-priorities__ and the knowledgeable candidates who deserve our attention and votes. Sign up with a friend!\n\nWe are asking those who are willing to make a commitment to help restore __the nation to its fullness__ – but first we are going to tell you why the next few weeks-months and beyond are so important.  We have entered the final stretch of this election campaign, and we are counting on every member of this team to VOTE SMART and mobilize-educate and register others within their networks.\n\nWhile we reflect on the past and look towards the future with hope and intention, the election directions discussions will be an __analysis of our democracy.__  We want you to bring your best ideas, your truth meters, and your favorite relevant political topics to the discussion.  And once you register, make sure your colleagues-neighbors, families-friends and communities join too!\n\n__Final Election Results:__ There will be an official-final Elections Reflections discussion when the collective votes are all counted, tallied and certified by each of the states. The date-time will be added to the schedule. Stay tuned! Stay connected!\n\nCopyright © 2020-2022 Communities United | 2020 Victorious!",

    "description": "In this info session, we will make space to contend with the current political moment and give you a snapshot of the work Harriet’s Wildest Dreams is engaged in. Our liberation is tied to one another and we need each other to do this work  to protect our people — Black people, formerly incarcerated folks, queer and trans communities, and all those at risk of state sanctioned violence. \n\nBeing in the nation's capital we are at the center of the empire and also a target for far right extremists. DC is NO ONE’s playground and we must remain vigilant in our fight for statehood, our fight against mass incarceration and the fight for gender liberation and bodily autonomy for all. \n\nIf you and your friends are interested in building a better world, free from patriarchal violence, a world where queer is in, then you've come to the right place! Come sit with us as we re-imagine what this world can be and reclaim safety for all of DC. \n\n\nWho Are We: \n\nWe are a Black-led abolitionist community defense hub centering all Black lives most at risk for state-sanctioned violence in the Greater Washington area.\n\nWhat we do: \n\nOur work includes legal empowerment, political and civic education, mass protest, organizing campaigns, and community care that builds alternatives to oppressive systems.\n\nIf you are in need of ASL interpretation please let us know at least 48 hours in advance.",

    "description": "You can run for public office - or help someone else win.\n\nLearn the basics of running for office including honing your message, building your team, designing your campaign plan, asking for donations, and running a field campaign. If you've ever thought about running for office, this is a great space to explore that more deeply. This approach focuses on leveraging skills you might have developed in grassroots issue-based organizing work and applies them to run for office. You'll lean into issues, build a leaderful campaign, and incorporate racial justice into your efforts.\n\nWe'll have special guests share their experience running for office and more.\n\nThis training is 2 days\n\nPart 1 is August 9, 2025, 12-4pm ET\n\nPart 2 is August 16, 2025 12-4pm ET\n\nThis is a virtual training that will be held online on zoom.",

Then, they tell you about the plan they have to replace Central Hudson with a publicly owned utility company so that your electric bills go down and invite you to be a part of it... You'd probably be pretty happy they called, right?! \n\nOn Thursday night, we're going to be the ones calling to share the good news. \n\nOur phonebanking objective varies based on what we want to mobilize people around. Right now we're focusing on letting tenants know about their protections under ETPA/GCE (don't worry if you don't know what these abbreviations mean!), the Hudson Valley Power Authority, and HR9495. \n\nWe have a script, we have the phone numbers to call, and we have a training so that you'll have everything you need to have great conversations. Plus, we'll have hot cocoa waiting for you!\n\n***Please bring a laptop, phone, and headphones***",

    "description": "Welcome to Generation Vote! We are the only national youth-led electoral justice organization that is sparking an intersectional youth-led movement that fights for our right to vote and a just democracy for all.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the \"red wave\" during the 2022 midterm election, politicians have aggressively shifted their attention to state legislatures in a continued attempt to thwart our democracy. These efforts are being funded by the very same mega-wealthy donors and corporations who are blocking progress on issues that our generation cares about, such as climate justice or student loan debt relief. In order to ensure real progress we must have a just democracy for all. \n\nThere’s no doubt about it: In 2025, the anti-democracy movement will do everything within its power to silence the most diverse generation that our country has ever seen - US. \n\nBut just like a phoenix, we will rise from the ashes of our broken democracy in order to create a government that reflects our diverse communities and transform what is possible in our homes, schools, places of worship and workplaces. We believe that it's up to our generation to achieve a truly multiracial and just democracy for all people in this country.\n\nCan you feel it? The power of a just democracy? Because we can.\n\nJoin us for a 1-hour welcome call to connect with young folks from across the country, learn more about our movement strategy, and find out how to plug-into the movement.\n\n \n\nAccessibility Information\n\nLive captioning can be provided during the call. Have additional accessibility questions? Reply to your registration email to confirm your requirements or request more information.",

    "description": "As a volunteer, you’ll be right in the action, collecting food scraps from market-goers—the first step in a crucial process that turns waste into nutrient-rich compost. These scraps, gathered at local markets, are then processed at nearby green parks or gardens. Throughout your shift, you'll be guided by an experienced LA Compost staff member, who will act as your Compost Manager, offering insights and helping you share the benefits of composting with the public. The best part is during your volunteer shift, you can take some time to shop the market. Join us and be part of the composting movement that's transforming LA—one food scrap at a time!\n\n#### ABOUT ACTIVITY:\nAs a volunteer, you’ll play a hands-on role in guiding market-goers through composting, ensuring their food scraps are clean of stickers, compostable, and ready to be turned into nutrient-rich compost. You’ll monitor for contamination, assist with tracking data, and serve as a friendly, welcoming host to our composting community. \n\n#### MORE INFO: \n* You'll be stationed at the LA Compost booth under a pop-up canopy within the farmers' market. There will also be seating available.\n* You may be asked to assist with moving filled bins of material weighing 60+ pounds. We always offer team lifts; you will never be asked to lift bins if you prefer not to.\n* No prior composting experience is needed; everyone is welcome!\n* Bathrooms are available. \n* If you sign up, please show up! We rely on volunteers like you to achieve our mission.  \n* We’ll follow up with details via email, so be sure to provide your best contact email when signing up.\n\n#### AGE REQUIREMENT:\nThis volunteer activity is best suited for volunteers aged 16 and up.

    "description": "As a volunteer, you’ll be right in the action, collecting food scraps from community members; the first step in a crucial process that turns waste into nutrient-rich compost. These scraps, gathered, are then processed at nearby green parks or gardens. Throughout your shift, you'll be guided by an experienced LA Compost staff member, who will act as your Compost Manager, offering insights and helping you share the benefits of composting with the public.  Join us and be part of the composting movement that's transforming LA—one food scrap at a time!\n\n#### ABOUT ACTIVITY:\nAs a volunteer, you’ll play a hands-on role in guiding community members through dropping off, ensuring their food scraps are clean of stickers and ready to be turned into nutrient-rich compost. You’ll monitor for contamination, assist with tracking data, and serve as a friendly, welcoming host to our composting community. \n\n#### MORE INFO:  \n* You'll be stationed at the LA Compost booth under a pop-up canopy within the farmers' market. There will also be seating available.\n* You may be asked to assist with moving filled bins of material weighing 60+ pounds. We always offer team lifts; you will never be asked to lift bins if you prefer not to.\n* No prior composting experience is needed; everyone is welcome!\n* Bathrooms are NOT available \n* If you sign up, please show up! We rely on volunteers like you to achieve our mission.  \n* We’ll follow up with details via email, so be sure to provide your best contact email when signing up.\n\n#### AGE REQUIREMENT:\nThis volunteer activity is best suited for volunteers aged 16 and up. Minors under 16 should come accompanied by a parent or guardian unless other arrangements are made. Contact ashleigh@lacompost.org for more information.\n\n#### Location History:\nThis collection location is not at a farmers' market! Amidst the height of the pandemic in March 2020, we paused farmers' market collections to allow for greater social distancing. We moved about a mile away from the Atwater Village Farmers' Market to right outside the Elysian Valley Community Garden. This location was so popular that we decided to stay even after it was safe to return to the market again.",

    "description": "As a volunteer, you’ll be right in the action, collecting food scraps from market-goers—the first step in a crucial process that turns waste into nutrient-rich compost. These scraps, gathered at local markets, are then processed at nearby green parks or gardens. Throughout your shift, you'll be guided by an experienced LA Compost staff member, who will act as your Compost Manager, offering insights and helping you share the benefits of composting with the public. The best part is that during your volunteer shift, you can take some time to shop at the market. Join us and be part of the composting movement that's transforming LA—one food scrap at a time!\n\n#### ABOUT ACTIVITY:\nAs a volunteer, you’ll play a hands-on role in guiding market-goers through composting, ensuring their food scraps are clean of stickers, compostable, and ready to be turned into nutrient-rich compost. You’ll monitor for contamination, assist with tracking data, and serve as a friendly, welcoming host to our composting community. \n\n#### MORE INFO: \n* You'll be stationed at the LA Compost booth under a pop-up canopy within the farmers' market. There will also be seating available.\n* You may be asked to assist with moving filled bins of material weighing 60+ pounds. We always offer team lifts; you will never be asked to lift bins if you prefer not to.\n* No prior composting experience is needed; everyone is welcome!\n* Bathrooms are accessible\n* If you sign up, please show up! We rely on volunteers like you to achieve our mission.  \n* We’ll follow up with details via email, so be sure to provide your best contact email when signing up.\n\n#### AGE REQUIREMENT:\nThis volunteer activity is best suited for volunteers aged 16 and up. Minors under 16 should come accompanied by a parent or guardian unless other arrangements are made. Contact ashleigh@lacompost.org for more information.\n\n#### IMPORTANT: VOLUNTEER WAIVER\nPlease make sure you have signed the volunteer waiver. \nAccess the e-wavier at https://www.lacompost.org/waiver",

We review and implement the action plans to put Democrats in office at the local, state and national level. Our focus is on building neighborhood teams with feet-on-the ground to engage with voters in our own communities and encourage them to cast their ballots, request the option to vote by mail and stay engaged on the issues.

    "description": "As a volunteer, you’ll be right in the action, collecting food scraps from market-goers—the first step in a crucial process that turns waste into nutrient-rich compost. These scraps, gathered at local markets, are then processed at nearby green parks or gardens. Throughout your shift, you'll be guided by an experienced LA Compost staff member, who will act as your Compost Manager, offering insights and helping you share the benefits of composting with the public. The best part is that during your volunteer shift, you can take some time to shop at the market. Join us and be part of the composting movement that's transforming LA—one food scrap at a time!\n\n#### ABOUT ACTIVITY:\nAs a volunteer, you’ll play a hands-on role in guiding market-goers through composting, ensuring their food scraps are clean of stickers, compostable, and ready to be turned into nutrient-rich compost. You’ll monitor for contamination, assist with tracking data, and serve as a friendly, welcoming host to our composting community. \n\n#### MORE INFO: \n* You'll be stationed at the LA Compost booth under a pop-up canopy within the farmers' market. There will also be seating available.\n* You may be asked to assist with moving filled bins of material weighing 60+ pounds. We always offer team lifts; you will never be asked to lift bins if you prefer not to.\n* No prior composting experience is needed; everyone is welcome!\n* Bathrooms are accessible\n* If you sign up, please show up! We rely on volunteers like you to achieve our mission.  \n* We’ll follow up with details via email, so be sure to provide your best contact email when signing up.\n\n#### AGE REQUIREMENT:\nThis volunteer activity is best suited for volunteers aged 16 and up. Minors under 16 should come accompanied by a parent or guardian unless other arrangements are made. Contact ashleigh@lacompost.org for more information.\n\n#### IMPORTANT: VOLUNTEER WAIVER\nPlease make sure you have signed the volunteer waiver. \nAccess the e-wavier at https://www.lacompost.org/waiver",

    "description": "This monthly status update event is on ZOOM.  It will be followed by letter/postcard writing on your own.  There are separate events to attend in-person letter/postcard writing at multiple locations. \n\nMarch was spent writing Vote Forward letters to WI for their state supreme court special election on 4/1.\n\nApril and May will be writing postcards to registered voters of color in VA before the primary election with the Center for Common Ground and their Reclaim Our Vote campaign. \n \nJune will be writing GOTV postcards to VA with the Progressive Turnout Project.  \n\nJuly through October we expect to have Vote Forward letters to VA.\n\nThe evening will start with a 10-15 minute status update. \nThe April and May presentation will include Swing Left's 3 to Win strategy to take back the House in 2026.\n\nThen  we'll dive into writing letters/postcards. You can stay on zoom to be connected to the in-person meetings or drop off and write at your own pace.\n\nHow to get your postcards:\nThrough The working Circle for the Center for Common Ground (these go fast):\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScyrmMKGCBNkMIsdSTBgW1Tp9o8y5VsyfZNhPR-Gs9nIw12Rw/viewform?usp=sharing\n\nThrough the Center for Common Ground and their Reclaim Our Vote postcard campaigns (very specific instructions):\nhttps://www.centerforcommonground.org\nhttps://www.centerforcommonground.org/reclaim-our-vote\n \nFor the Progressive Turnout Project:\nturnoutpac.org\nYou will need 1-4 weeks to prepare for June.\n\nHow to get your VOTE FORWARD letters:\nSign up as a volunteer on Vote Forward at votefwd.org/swingleft. It takes a day or so to get approved as a volunteer, so plan to sign up 3-4 days ahead of the event.\nDownload 20 letters to write at the event and gather your materials. You will need 20 first class stamps, a blue pen, and 20 #10 business envelopes. Swing Left’s “Write Letters from Home” page has step-by-step information to help you get set up on Vote Forward and download letters, including a short video.\n\n\n\nand now the small print:\nJoin me to learn about building grassroots power for all the fights to come. Together, we can defeat the anti-democratic movement within the Republican party, dismantle the GOP's advantage in key swing states, and maintain and expand Democratic power at the federal level. \n\nIf you haven’t heard of it, Swing Left is a national network that helps people find high impact ways to support Democratic candidates. We focus on the most flippable races as an important step towards ensuring the progressive change needed to create a more inclusive and equitable government and society.",

Broad and ambitious in scope, the Agenda addresses the three dimensions of sustainable development: social, economic and environmental, as well as important aspects related to peace, justice and effective institutions.\n\n__December 31, 2025:__ Register for this 17-SDGs meeting discussion date, _when-if_ you are up-to-date with the past 17-SDGs readings.  Join the next meeting discussion to learn how to read the 17-SDGs effectively-independently on your own.\n\n__The 17 Sustainable Development Goals [(SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)__ build on the eight  Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which specifically sought by 2015: to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; achieve universal primary education; promote gender equality and empower women; reduce child mortality; improve maternal health; combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; ensure environmental sustainability; and develop a global partnership for development.\n\n__Do you know all 17 SDGs?__ [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XTBYMfZyrM&t=84s)\n“They are a to-do list for people and planet, and a blueprint for success,” of the 17 goals and 169 targets to wipe out poverty, fight inequality and tackle climate change over the next 15 years between the years 2015 through 2030.\n\n“The seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are our shared vision of humanity and a social contract between the world’s leaders and the people,” UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted unanimously by 193 Heads of State and other top leaders at a summit at UN Headquarters in New York in September 2015.\n\nBut progress has been uneven across regions and countries, leaving millions of people behind, especially the poorest and those disadvantaged due to sex, age, disability, ethnicity or geographic location. Targeted efforts will be needed to reach the most vulnerable people.\n\nThis is where the SDGs are expected to play a part. They stress everything from zero poverty, zero hunger, good health, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, and affordable clean energy, to decent work and economic growth, innovation, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities, responsible consumption, climate action, unpolluted oceans and land, and partnerships to achieve the goals.\n\nCopyright © 2021-2024 Communities United | 2020 Victorious!",

The documentary introduces ways to help bring the civil rights and social justice system into alignment with democracy.\n\nUncover the deep spiritual significance of America’s newest federal holiday with pastor Rasool Berry in \"Juneteenth: Faith & Freedom,\" a new documentary film presented by the Our Daily Bread Voices Collection and Our Daily Bread Media.  Learn how Scripture inspired the faith of enslaved people, travel to the church where America’s first Juneteenth celebration took place, and uncover why newly liberated men and women credited God for their freedom.\n\nWith special guests Ms. Opal Lee, Lecrae, and more, you’ll journey to Galveston, Texas to discover a faith stronger than suffering.\n\n- - - - -\n\n__\"Juneteenth: Faith & Freedom | A Documentary\"__ exposes how America’s history of enslavement and social injustice evolved into an enormous movement for civil rights and social justice empowerment. Through first-person accounts of those charged with guarding the history of Juneteenth in Galveston, Texas under the paralleled stories about the systems of today, the film brings to light a powerful imagery of racial inequality. With the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement, this film provides historical context and examines America’s history of racist oppression.\n\n[A black man is troubled by the legacy of American slavery and the misuse of Christianity to justify it. He travels throughout Texas and discovers how the Juneteenth holiday reveals a resilient hope that empowered the formerly enslaved and their descendants to fight for freedom in an often unjust society.]\n\n- - - - -\n\nBy joining the 2020 Victorious | Communities United team, you will receive access to (i) regular updates on the latest political action news, (ii) invites to regional-state-local programs-events that directly impact the community, government and the nation, and (iii) relevant educational training to provide the information-knowledge to be effective within your region-states and local communities.\n\n __Worth Repeating:__ The intent is to equip all member-participants to be effective community leaders-organizers and have a more widespread, impactful voice within more of the nation's most affected communities.\n\nCopyright © 2021-2023 Communities United | 2020 Victorious!",

    "description": "As a volunteer, you’ll be right in the action, collecting food scraps from market-goers—the first step in a crucial process that turns waste into nutrient-rich compost. These scraps, gathered at local markets, are then processed at nearby green parks or gardens. Throughout your shift, you'll be guided by an experienced LA Compost staff member, who will act as your Compost Manager, offering insights and helping you share the benefits of composting with the public. The best part is that during your volunteer shift, you can take some time to shop at the market. Join us and be part of the composting movement that's transforming LA—one food scrap at a time!\n\n#### ABOUT ACTIVITY:\nAs a volunteer, you’ll play a hands-on role in guiding market-goers through composting, ensuring their food scraps are clean of stickers, compostable, and ready to be turned into nutrient-rich compost. You’ll monitor for contamination, assist with tracking data, and serve as a friendly, welcoming host to our composting community. \n\n#### MORE INFO: \n* You'll be stationed at the LA Compost booth under a pop-up canopy within the farmers' market. There will also be seating available.\n* You may be asked to assist with moving filled bins of material weighing 60+ pounds. We always offer team lifts; you will never be asked to lift bins if you prefer not to.\n* No prior composting experience is needed; everyone is welcome!\n* There is a porta potty on site\n* If you sign up, please show up! We rely on volunteers like you to achieve our mission.  \n* We’ll follow up with details via email, so be sure to provide your best contact email when signing up.\n\n#### AGE REQUIREMENT:\nThis volunteer activity is best suited for volunteers aged 16 and up. Minors under 16 should come accompanied by a parent or guardian unless other arrangements are made. Contact ashleigh@lacompost.org for more information.\n\n#### IMPORTANT: VOLUNTEER WAIVER\nPlease make sure you have signed the volunteer waiver. \nAccess the e-wavier at https://www.lacompost.org/waiver",

    "description": "This event is ONLY for IN-PERSON letter/postcard writing attendees. There is a separate zoom event for a monthly status update and letter/postcard writing on your own.\n\nMarch was spent writing Vote Forward letters to WI for their state supreme court special election on 4/1.\n\nApril and May will be writing postcards to registered voters of color in VA before the primary election with the Center for Common Ground and their Reclaim Our Vote campaign.  If you want to learn more about the Center for Common Ground and their Reclaim Our Vote postcard campaigns here are the links:\nhttps://www.centerforcommonground.org\nhttps://www.centerforcommonground.org/reclaim-our-vote\n\n\nJune will be writing GOTV postcards to VA with the Progressive Turnout Project.  \n\nJuly through October we expect to have Vote Forward letters to VA.\n\nThe evening will start with a 10-15 minute status update. The April presentation will include Swing Left's 3 to Win strategy to take back the House in 2026. \n\nThen we'll dive into writing. \nIf letters: We'll have the letters printed. You bring a blue pen, 20 envelopes, and 20 first class stamps.\nIf postcards: We'll have the postcards, addresses, and Stick-on labels with election information. They encourage people to use multiple colors of pens to make the postcards more eye-catching.  And bring 20 postcard stamps ($0.56).\n\n\n\n\nand now for the small print:\nJoin me for a letter writing party, where we'll be writing letters using an award-winning, proven tactic to reach potential voters in important upcoming elections.\n\nRSVP here, and we’ll let you know how to join this party. Invite your friends, too and let them know that Swing Left is pioneering an innovative program, using letters to help volunteers like us turn out voters through our letter-writing affiliate, Vote Forward.\n\nThink about it: if you help get a voter to the polls, that is an important step towards creating a more inclusive and equitable government and society. Looking forward to seeing you!",

    "description": "JOIN DEMOCRACY MATTERS! supporters from all across the nation for Juneteenth, a day to celebrate freedom, culture, and progress. Juneteenth marks the end of slavery in America and commemorates the collective freedom of African-Americans.  Celebrated annually on June 19th, Juneteenth honors the date that 250,000 enslaved Texans learned that their freedom had been secured by the Emancipation Proclamation – two full years after it was signed.\n\nToday, Juneteenth is a call-to-action for all of us across the country to come together, and honor and continue the work of those before us who fought for Black lives, Black voices, and Black votes.  We will have the opportunity to envision a path forward, as we acknowledge the legacy of Juneteenth in Galveston, Texas!\n\n- - - - -\n\n[The dates scheduled after Juneteenth are introductory workshops and updates to the national unification project.]\n\n__The Juneteenth Guidance and National Action Plan__ resources will be distributed during the event presentations on June 18-19, 2023.  The National Action Plan will include outreach to federal-state legislatures with a connective message about the historic relevance of Juneteenth to current legislation.  _Any-all dates-times scheduled prior to June 18-19, 2023 are in advance preparation of the Juneteenth ABCDEs.™_  __The dates scheduled after Juneteenth are for additions and progress updates on the Juneteenth ABCDEs.™__\n\nADVANCE PREPARATION:  __The Juneteenth ABCDEs™__ for national acknowledgements, benefits, commercialization, dedications, and education to constructively memorialize-highlight the most impactful goals to nationalize-unify and progress-promote the visions of Juneteenth for all Americans.  Please complete and submit a thoughtful-detailed plan description for national unification to have your ideas and submissions included in __the final national unification work product__ ... (one paragraph, a few sentences is sufficient).  This is an ongoing project with scheduled meeting updates.\n\n#Juneteenth #JuneteenthABCDEs\n\n- - - - -\n\nThis is the reason Democracy Matters! and 2020 Victorious! | Communities United are hosting our Juneteenth Weekend of Action from Friday-Monday, June 16-19, 2023. We are calling on you to participate by organizing voter education-registration-empowerment drives in your local community!\n\nDEMOCRACY MATTERS! is counting on all of us to participate by registering our colleagues-neighbors, families-friends and communities to ensure that eligible voters check and update their voter registration status during the National Voter Registration Year of Action. We are calling on you to participate by registering your friends, family, and neighbors, and helping eligible voters check and update their voter registration.\n\nHead over to a high traffic area in your community (laundromat, grocery store, barbershop, etc.) to register voters, make it a part of your family reunion or cookout with friends, or set up a voter registration table at a local Juneteenth celebration in your community. Whatever you’re doing – make registering voters a key part of it!\n\nSaving our democracy has never been led by the people in power – it’s been led by each one of us, and it starts in our communities.\n\n160 million Americans cast their ballots in 2020 – shattering voter turnout records and making history. And we can’t stop now. There is still work to be done before we head #BacktotheBallotBox!\n\nELECTION PROTECTION HOTLINE: Telephone or Text 866-OUR-VOTE (866-687-8683) * Tweet @866OURVOTE\n\nCopyright © 2021-2023 Communities United | 2020 Victorious!",

There is a separate zoom event for a monthly status update and letter/postcard writing on your own.\n\nMarch was spent writing Vote Forward letters to WI for their state supreme court special election on 4/1.\n\nApril and May will be writing postcards to registered voters of color in VA before the primary election with the Center for Common Ground and their Reclaim Our Vote campaign.  If you want to learn more about the Center for Common Ground and their Reclaim Our Vote postcard campaigns here are the links:\nhttps://www.centerforcommonground.org\nhttps://www.centerforcommonground.org/reclaim-our-vote\n\n\nJune will be writing GOTV postcards to VA with the Progressive Turnout Project.  \n\nJuly through October we expect to have Vote Forward letters to VA.\n\nOn the second Tuesday of the month, the evening will start with a 10-15 minute status update. The April and May presentation will include Swing Left's 3 to Win strategy to take back the House in 2026. \n\nThen we'll dive into writing. \nIf letters: We'll have the letters printed. You bring a blue pen, 20 envelopes, and 20 first class stamps.\nIf postcards: We'll have the postcards, addresses, and Stick-on labels with election information. They encourage people to use multiple colors of pens to make the postcards more eye-catching.  And bring 20 postcard stamps ($0.56).\n\n\n\n\nand now for the small print:\nJoin me for a letter writing party, where we'll be writing letters using an award-winning, proven tactic to reach potential voters in important upcoming elections.\n\nRSVP here, and we’ll let you know how to join this party. Invite your friends, too and let them know that Swing Left is pioneering an innovative program, using letters to help volunteers like us turn out voters through our letter-writing affiliate, Vote Forward.\n\nThink about it: if you help get a voter to the polls, that is an important step towards creating a more inclusive and equitable government and society.

The goal is to have a petition for expungement drawn up after meeting with an attorney. \n\nThis event has been successful in the past, and we’re looking forward to this one. It provides the opportunity for people to walk away on the road to having certain criminal charges off their record. The only requirement is that these be Maryland residence, with the tenacity to see the process through. There might be further qualifications to have a record expunged, but that is what the attorneys are there to assist people in determining. \n\nYOU MUST BE REGISTERED TO RECEIVE SERVICES! \n\nIf you are a member of the media and have questions about this, please contact Life After Release at 240.200.4472 or lifeafterreleasemd@gmail.com.",

    "description": "As a volunteer, you’ll be right in the action, collecting food scraps from market-goers—the first step in a crucial process that turns waste into nutrient-rich compost. These scraps, gathered at local markets, are then processed at nearby green parks or gardens. Throughout your shift, you'll be guided by an experienced LA Compost staff member, who will act as your Compost Manager, offering insights and helping you share the benefits of composting with the public. The best part is that during your volunteer shift, you can take some time to shop at the market. Join us and be part of the composting movement that's transforming LA—one food scrap at a time!\n\n#### ABOUT ACTIVITY:\nAs a volunteer, you’ll play a hands-on role in guiding market-goers through composting, ensuring their food scraps are clean of stickers, compostable, and ready to be turned into nutrient-rich compost. You’ll monitor for contamination, assist with tracking data, and serve as a friendly, welcoming host to our composting community. \n\n#### MORE INFO: \n* You'll be stationed at the LA Compost booth under a pop-up canopy within the farmers' market. There will also be seating available.\n* You may be asked to assist with moving filled bins of material weighing 60+ pounds. We always offer team lifts; you will never be asked to lift bins if you prefer not to.\n* No prior composting experience is needed; everyone is welcome!\n* Bathrooms are NOT available\n* If you sign up, please show up! We rely on volunteers like you to achieve our mission.  \n* We’ll follow up with details via email, so be sure to provide your best contact email when signing up.\n\n#### AGE REQUIREMENT:\nThis volunteer activity is best suited for volunteers aged 16 and up. Minors under 16 should come accompanied by a parent or guardian unless other arrangements are made. Contact ashleigh@lacompost.org for more information.\n\n#### IMPORTANT: VOLUNTEER WAIVER\nPlease make sure you have signed the volunteer waiver. \nAccess the e-wavier at https://www.lacompost.org/waiver",

How you celebrate is ultimately up to you, but for some inspiration, check out the Vote Early Day [(toolkit)](https://voteearlyday.org/toolkit/).\n\nAs you work to build a successful celebration, consider the following:\n\n__Encourage ballot research and plan making.__ \nEverywhere in America, eligible voters can research their ballots and make a plan to vote. Our partners are steering voters to resources to identify options to vote early or on election day.\n\n__Throw a party or parade.__\nThrough parties at the polls and community parades to early voting sites, organizations across the country will inspire more Americans to vote early. Even in states without in-person early voting, friends can come together to fill-in their mail-in ballots.\n\n__Spread the word.__\nThrough mass on-air or digital marketing, media companies will teach Americans how to vote early by pointing them to local events and resources to cast their ballots.\n\n__Attend-Host an event.__\nFlagship events across the country will feature major talent, local election administrators, and thousands of voters.\n\nWith November right around the corner, today is a perfect time to start thinking about how you will encourage your colleagues-neighbors, family-friends and communities to vote early by celebrating Vote Early Day on October 26, 2023!\n\nCopyright © 2021-2023 Communities United | 2020 Victorious!",

    "description": "As a volunteer, you’ll be right in the action, collecting food scraps from market-goers—the first step in a crucial process that turns waste into nutrient-rich compost. These scraps, gathered at local markets, are then processed at nearby green parks or gardens. Throughout your shift, you'll be guided by an experienced LA Compost staff member, who will act as your Compost Manager, offering insights and helping you share the benefits of composting with the public. The best part is that during your volunteer shift, you can take some time to shop at the market. Join us and be part of the composting movement that's transforming LA—one food scrap at a time!\n\n#### ABOUT ACTIVITY:\nAs a volunteer, you’ll play a hands-on role in guiding market-goers through composting, ensuring their food scraps are clean of stickers, compostable, and ready to be turned into nutrient-rich compost. You’ll monitor for contamination, assist with tracking data, and serve as a friendly, welcoming host to our composting community. \n\n#### MORE INFO: \n* You'll be stationed at the LA Compost booth under a pop-up canopy within the farmers' market. There will also be seating available.\n* You may be asked to assist with moving filled bins of material weighing 60+ pounds. We always offer team lifts; you will never be asked to lift bins if you prefer not to.\n* No prior composting experience is needed; everyone is welcome!\n* Bathrooms are NOT available. \n* If you sign up, please show up!

    "description": "Many factors can __motivate people to participate in elections.__ Some of the most common reasons include a desire to have their voices heard, a belief that their vote can make a difference, a sense of civic duty, a disposition about political issues (personal values), or a desire to support a particular candidate or party.\n\nWith the __midterm and national elections__ happening every year, and __state primary and special elections__ happening nearly every month, we will analyze-discuss not only _how_ will Americans vote, but also _why_ they are planning to vote that way.\n\nThe new national polls that examine the electorate in an effort to understand what exactly is motivating voters to vote will be reviewed. The studies of both Democratic likely voters and Republican likely voters reveal that voters are animated by either party values or economic issues.  The question is whether state and national elections are determined by either of the major parties or by a larger majority of Independent voters.\n\nThose are the broad overviews, but the devil in the details is always the voter turnout. At the end of the day, in this case, Election Day, the key is __motivating voters to cast their ballots.__  Voter turnout is essential, if not the most important, key to winning an election. \n\nThe __\"Analyze the Issues that Motivate Voters\"__ event program _requires_ advance preparation-knowledge and is intended for voters with voter registration knowlege-experiences.  This event program is not a basic voter registration presentation.\n\n*** NEW ***\n\nQ: Are you prepared to Motivate Registered Voters? ... (review upon registration confirmation)\n\nReview \"National Voter Education-Registration-Empowerment Year of Action\" [(mobilization)](www.mobilize.us/2020victorious/event/580830/) and _all referenced links._\n\nThe 2024 Election season will include innovative community-based organizing with a national program platform to engage networks in local-regional-state-national communities to educate-register-mobilize voters for state-by-state 'down-ballot' and primary-presidential elections, and to reclaim the U.S. House of Representatives, expand the U.S. Senate, and secure the White House for the democracy we deserve.\n\nThis program is a practical-functional skills training in community outreach and having persuasive conversations with colleagues-neighbors, family-friends and community networks, using relational organizing and community outreach to motivate all voters (frequent-infrequent) — we are excited to start organizing together!\n\n- - - - -\n\n- - - - -\n\n160 million Americans cast their ballots in 2020 – shattering voter turnout records and making history.  And we can’t stop now.  There is still work to be done before we are #VoteReady!\n\nELECTION PROTECTION HOTLINE: Call or Text 866-OUR-VOTE * Tweet @866OURVOTE\n\nCopyright © 2021-2023 Communities United | 2020 Victorious!",

    "description": "HELLO VOLUNTEERS!\nAt Feed Louisville, we often say that volunteers are the backbone of our organization. With help from people like you, we sent out 145,000 meals in 2023 to the houseless and food insecure community. Join us in the kitchen to help our team turn donated food into nutritious meals! From prepping vegetables, making sandwiches, packaging meals, and much more, there is plenty to help with!\n\nSHIFTS\nThere are two volunteer time slots to choose from; 9 am to 12 pm and/or 1 pm to 3:30 pm. If you need to come a little late or leave a little early, no problem at all. Sign up for the shift your schedule best aligns with!\n\nDRESS GUIDELINES\nWhen volunteering in our kitchen, we ask you to dress comfortably and appropriately! Open-toed shoes or dangling jewelry are not permitted as they pose a risk to your safety. It is best to wear non-slip shoes, bring a hat or bandana, and keep your hair tied back. Aprons and gloves will be provided!\n\nGROUPS\nIf you want to bring a group of 10 or more, please email volunteer@feedlouisville.org so we can work with you to schedule a date that works best!\n\nLOCATION\nOur kitchen is at 1334 Story Avenue Louisville, KY. Please read these directions before coming to volunteer!\n\nIf driving on Story Ave, the entrance to our parking lot is directly across from the Whirling Tiger, at the corner of Webster and Story. Enter through the open black gates on your left, drive until you come to the T in the road, then turn right. Drive towards the yellow dumpster at the end and enter our parking lot surrounded by a chain link fence. \n\nIf driving on North Spring Street, take a left at the Louisville Division Fire Station 3 and keep driving straight to the yellow dumpster and chain link fenced area. \n\nAfter parking, walk towards the building, and up the wooden stairs. Continue until you see a door that says \"Social Events and Feed Louisville\". Once inside, walk towards the double doors and turn right. Go through the white doors and around the bend to the volunteer station!\n\nIf you have trouble finding us, please call or text us at 502-418-7443 or 859-638-0237 and we will gladly guide you in the right direction!\n\nSAFETY AND AGE REQUIREMENTS\nFor safety reasons, we do not allow persons under 10 years of age to volunteer in our kitchen. Volunteers from 10 to 14 years old must be accompanied by an adult and will be assigned to non-kitchen tasks. Those 14 to 18 years old may be allowed to use knives or work around industrial kitchen equipment, depending on their experience level. Anyone 18 years and older can work in our production kitchen.\n\nTHANK YOU\nWe are grateful for your willingness to help us in our mission to rescue more food and put it into the hands of the houseless and food insecure in Louisville. If you cannot make it to our kitchen, consider sharing our story and the work of our community partners on social media, or consider donating to increase the number of people we can feed!\n\nLooking forward to meeting you,\nCaitlyn Morgan\nExpo and Volunteer Coordinator\n\nreach out to volunteer@feedlouisville.org with any questions!",

    "description": "Court watching is a tactic to raise public awareness about our legal system and to hold the system accountable through witnessing, documenting, and sharing experiences at bail hearings. This is a powerful and critical tool for organizing because so much harm is never witnessed and goes unchecked. Court watching is a tool of PEOPLE POWER against those in power. \n\nMN Freedom Funds court watching is a volunteer-based program aimed at shining a light on Ramsey County and Hennepin County Arraignment hearings. This is where money bail decisions are made and ultimately, people's access to pretrial freedom is determined.​\n\nHennepin County Court Watch Shifts are every 1st Thursday and every 2nd Monday of the month at 1:30 pm. \n\nRamsey County Court Watch Shifts every 4th Monday of the month at 9:00am\n\n*These dates are subject to change*",
