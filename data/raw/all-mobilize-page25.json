    "description": "The St. Charles Township Democrats invite you to the first installment of our new documentary screening series, where we explore critical issues affecting us locally, nationally, and globally.\n\nFor our inaugural screening, we’ll be watching “Finding the Money”, a thought-provoking documentary that challenges common misconceptions about the national debt and deficit spending.\n\nWith growing concerns from both sides of the aisle about deficit spending and how to fund key programs at the national level, this film offers a timely and insightful look at the myths surrounding the national debt.\n\nWe are gauging interest in attendance for this event. We have been in contact with the film’s producers and may have the opportunity to host a post-screening Q&A or discussion on the real-world application of these ideas in politics with individuals involved in the film.\n\nPlease RSVP to help us assess interest, communicate with the film’s producers, and secure the necessary screening kit and resources.\n\nJoin us for an evening of engaging discussion, learning, and community conversation. All are welcome!",

They are a pleasure to work with and also have\nfilms, clips and lesson plans for use, by teachers, on multiple topics. \n\nWe will have a speaker and allow discussion after. Lets use this chance to lift up and give grace to all who have been showing up, enduring their own trauma but fighting for a better world. \n\nLooking forward to making new friends, being inspired, and building community together!!",

We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*\n\nWe have **NO KINGS** here in America. And, _*we won't tolerate*_ a president who acts like one. So, join us at Alameda City Hall on Saturday June 14th from 12 noon till 1 PM to make our voices heard.\n\nAlso, we will have a food donation bin at the protest site in support of our neighbors in need. Please bring non-perishable food items for donation. Every little bit helps!

    "description": "Please sign up to attend a free screening of the groundbreaking documentary “Bad Faith: Christian Nationalism's Unholy War on Democracy.”\n\nThis powerful and disturbing documentary reveals how Christian Nationalism has become one of the most powerful political forces in the nation by spreading fear and anger and distorting political issues into battles between good and evil. Their ultimate goal – highlighted in their Project 2025 manifesto – is the destruction of church-state separation, inclusive religious freedom, LGBTQ+ and women’s rights, inclusive public schools and more… all while enshrining their narrow, religious beliefs into law for us to suffer under.\n\nFinanced by the secretive Council for National Policy, the movement has succeeded in infiltrating American politics and has become one of the most powerful political forces in the nation. Discover the origins of this organized grasp for power, and learn about the grassroots coalition of secular and interfaith leaders who are bravely confronting the grave threat Christian Nationalism poses to our democracy.",

Two years after President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, news reached Texas and, upon learning they were free, former slaves immediately began celebrating with prayer, feasting, song, and dance. The Juneteenth Celebration of Freedom will celebrate African American culture, heritage, and, most importantly, abolishment of slavery.\n\nThe Juneteenth Celebration of Freedom will feature an expanded kidz zone, live performances, food trucks, vendors, and fireworks show. It is a place for all races, nationalities, and religions to join hands and truthfully acknowledge a period in history that shaped and continues to influence our society today, according to a news release. This event is free and open to the public, and we encourage everyone to attend and learn more about the history and culture of Juneteenth!\n\nPlease sign up for a shift below and be a part of this Celebration of Freedom.",

The fight for justice is long—and if we’re going to stay in it, we need space to move, breathe, speak, and be heard.\n\nCome out, bring your family, move your body, and let your voice be heard!

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "The Collin County Democratic Party, in partnership with 50501, invites you to join us as we Stand Up for Democracy! This is a critical moment to raise our voices against the forces threatening our democracy, social security, constitutional rights, and the very foundations of our nation. While this event is sponsored by the Collin County Democratic Party, it is nonpartisan in nature, as we believe ALL Americans must be unified in this fight for our rights.\n\nThis Event WILL go on rain or shine!\n\n### We’re taking a stand against:\n\n- Donald Trump and his MAGA extremists, who continue to undermine free elections and push authoritarian agendas.\n\n- Elon Musk, whose unchecked influence and platforming of far-right extremism endanger our democracy.\n\n- The so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a shadowy effort to dismantle vital government functions.\n\n- All their enablers—corporate greed, voter suppression, attacks on marginalized communities, and the erosion of our civil liberties.\n\n### Why Protest Now? \nOur democracy is under siege. Social Security is at risk. The Constitution is being twisted to serve the powerful. Donald Trump \"doesn't know\" if everyone deserves due process (hint: it's what we're DUE!). Whether it’s attacks on reproductive rights, climate inaction, or the relentless assault on truth and justice—we’ve had enough!\n\nJoin us to demand accountability, defend our freedoms, and fight for a future where democracy works for ALL of us—not just the wealthy and well-connected.\n\n📢 Bring your signs, your anger, and your determination! Together, we will peacefully but assertively make our voices heard.\n\n#StandUpForDemocracy #SaveOurFuture #DefendTheConstitution\n\n📍 Location: Southeast corner of Preston Road and Gaylord Parkway in Frisco, TX. Feel free to park behind the Jared's Jewelers at 3110 Preston Rd, Frisco, TX 75034; we will congregate on the sidewalk on the SE corner of Preston and Gaylord.\n\n📅 Date & Time: May 17th, 2025 9-11am\n\nThis is OUR democracy. Let’s fight for it! ✊",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Everyone should have the right to run – and come to the voter as they are. This Pride Month, join us to explore what it means to run for office if you are an LGBTQ+ leader in the making. \n\n  \n\nBeing out and running for office can feel especially challenging right now. But it’s also why this training can be especially important. Acceptance, representation, a voice at the table, and the protection of our rights all work in tandem. Representation is how we got to a Supreme Court decision about marriage equality. More representation, especially at the grassroots level, is how we will get to have and keep more equality – in all ways – the law of the land. \n\n  \n\nAre you a member of the LGBTQ+ community and would you like to run for office? Are you perhaps considering a run for elected office but haven’t yet made the commitment to run or filed your candidacy? Then this virtual live training is for you! \n\n  \n\nJoin our expert trainer and come away with insights and next steps on the following topics:\n\n*   Understanding the steps necessary to run for office\n    \n*   Best practices for choosing which office to run for\n    \n*   Discerning if running is the right decision for you – especially if you are LGBTQ+ and have never run for office but are thinking about it\n    \n*   Identifying what kinds of supports you’ll need to run for office\n    \n*   Preparing for sharing your decision to run with your support network\n    \n\n  \n\nHave accessibility questions?

    "description": "**In America, we don’t put up with would-be kings.**\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption from Trump and his allies. We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*\n\nWe will rally in Rose Hill Park at 4pm and March through Berryville, returning to the park at 6pm.  Be prepared to march and shout!\n\nBring signs and banners, emphasizing-\nNo Tyrants!\nNo Kings!\nNo Oligarchs!",

    "description": "WHAT IS “NO KINGS”?\n\nNO KINGS is a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration. \n\n- We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political positions, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies. They think they rule—but we are bigger than even their worst aspirations.\n\n- Donald Trump is planning a military parade in Washington, D.C. on June 14. This display of might is intended to intimidate opponents and solidify his image as a strongman on our dime—we won’t stand by while that happens.\n\n- Instead of allowing this military parade to be the center of gravity, we will make action everywhere else the story of America that day: people coming together in communities across the country to reject strongman politics and corruption.\n\n- Alongside local organizers, partners, and leaders from across the pro-democracy & pro-worker movement, we will demonstrate organized people power that outpaces any authoritarian aspirations.\n\n* NO KINGS events should be additive and congruent with adjacent mobilizations and recognitions, including Veterans celebrations, Pride events, and Juneteenth on 6/19.",
