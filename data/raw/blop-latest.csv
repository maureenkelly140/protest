About this event
They're saying they're improving government efficiency, but they're really just cutting jobs and funding to make room in the budget for tax cuts for their billionaire friends.
We won't accept cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, or Social Security. We won't accept DOGE firing Forest Service workers who saved lives in Hurricane Helene. We won't accept Donald Trump and his co-president Elon Musk tearing our government apart from the inside out, and we're going to let Thom Tillis and the Republicans rubber-stamping the Trump-Musk agenda know how we really feel.
Down with DOGE.
Rally with the North Carolina Democrats in Raleigh on March 12th at 12pm. Sign up now for updates.

We are organizing a peaceful protest demanding a Public Town Hall outside Eric Burilson's office this Thursday, March 13, from 11 AM - 1 PM. Join as long as you'd like.

Politics
I just saw the Reddit post regarding Eric Burilson calling those who attend Town Halls ""nutjobs."" The timing couldn't be more funny, because this week I've been communicating with his office directly to request a Public Town Hall, which he's outright refused. I've informed them that we plan to organize this week for folks to demand accountability. The event has been cleared by the city. Feel free to join with your signs, questions, concerns, or stories for as long as you like. Even if you just want to come for 15 minutes during your lunch break, we'd love to have you.

For the record, Eric Burilson has NEVER held a public Town Hall. Instead, he holds ""Tele-Town Halls"" where all questions are pre-screened or pre-selected. They say this it to prohibit people from screaming or causing a scene. And they claim they screening is to ensure people aren't asking repeated questions. But I guarantee you, they will now allow a single question to be asked that they don't want to answer. That isn't facilitating civil discourse....it's avoiding accountability.

Regardless of where you stand, it should be an expectation, not a privilege, to directly engage with your Congressman. This isn't about red or blue, this is about democracy. This is a peaceful protest, and we intend to be civil yet firm.

The address is as follows.

DATE: Thursday, March 13th
TIME: 12PM
LOCATION: Faunce Arch

Last Sunday, Columbia graduate student and Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil was kidnapped by the Department of Homeland Security and is now being held as a political prisoner. This comes after waves of both university and state repression of student organizing efforts for Palestine, as well as mass deportation orders that continue to threaten and terrorize our communities.

Brown Divest Coalition and Brown Activist Coalition calls upon our campus community to mobilize THURSDAY against this blatant display of fascist state violence. We refuse to let the Trump administration strip away our right to protest and put our students at risk of arrest, detention, and deportation. Brown University has stated that they will ""follow the law"" in regards to the presence of ICE and DHS on our campus - indicating their anticipatory obedience to fascist state interests. We demand that the Brown administration protect its students. ICE has no place on our campus or in the Providence community.

See you Thursday!","This is a call to action for a rally and march in support of Mahmoud Khalil happening on Thursday, March 13th, at Faunce Arch at 12 PM. Organized by the Brown Divest Coalition and Brown Activist Coalition, the event protests the detention of Mahmoud Khalil and opposes the presence and actions of ICE on campus."

About this event
Trump is attempting to dismantle the Department of Education. This is cruel and illegal – a direct attack on public schools, students, and our communities.
Thursday, March 13 we'll rally at the U.S. Department of Education in Washington, DC in opposition.
In the last couple of days Trump and Elon have:
- fired half of the staff of the DoEd meaning worse education for disabled students, poor students, rural students and Black/brown students
- worse resources for teachers across the country
- falsely started investigating 60 universities for practicing freedom of speech
- and is planning to deport a Columbia student, Mahmoud Khalil, for exercising his freedom of speech despite being a green card holder
That's not right!
When students, teachers, and our communities are under attack, we stand up and fight back. Courage spreads like wildfire.

Join us for an online Intro to Bannering, a visual tactic Backbone Campaign has been leading on for the last 23 years! Thursday, March 13th at 5pm Pacific /7pm Central /8pm Eastern RSVP for the zoom link. At this workshop, we'll walk through the materials we use and how to put together a banner. We'll show you how to ""rig"" your banner to poles and tips for safely and legally deploying it on a freeway overpass. (These banners also work great in marches, at events behind a speaker, at intersections, ferry terminals and more.) We'll provide info on how you can get one of our banner kits to create and deploy banners in your community - or if you want to source your own materials, we'll have suggestions on resources. Overpass bannering is a highly visible and 100% legal way for folks to take action together. It only takes 2-4 people and an hour of time to reach tens of thousands of people and make them feel less alone - and maybe inspire them to stand up as well!","An online workshop on creating and deploying freeway overpass banners will be held on March 13, 2025, organized by Amy_backbone.

From Friday March 14th at rush hour until Sunday March 16th at 5pm, get your friends together, claim a bridge and make your voices heard! This event is a great way to take part in protesting at your own leisure while staying in your local area. Each bridge is different and will require your own creative ways to deliver your message.

- Please leave the bridges better than you found them. Leave no trace of zip ties, duct tape, etc! If you are able to beautify it, clean up the litter you see from the winter thaw.

- Bring some snacks and drinks so you can sustain yourself! Dress accordingly as bridges can be windy.

- Always practice safety while on bridges. Only takeover bridges where pedestrians are allowed to walk on them. Do not block pedestrian or vehicular pathways and look into your local ordinances so as not to break any laws.","The image describes a public event called ""Bridge Takeover"" organized by 50501 MI, happening from March 14, 2025, at 5:00 PM to March 16, 2025, at 5:00 PM.

Join the Berks Dems and allies to demonstrate against DOGE. Many of us have been making phone calls to our representatives, which is absolutely essential. However, a lot of people have also been reaching out about protests and rallies.  

We are barraged every single day with more and more draconian actions by the Trump/Musk administration. Enough is enough!  

Medicare  
Medicaid  
Social Security  
Veteran Services  
Immigration  
Equality  

These are all under extreme attack and being dismantled quickly and brutally.  

We are planning the first protest on 3/15. We will assemble at the shopping center parking lot area at 11:00  

Bring signs and/or join us at the Berks County Democratic office at 1251 North Front St. this Wednesday at 6 PM to help make signs for the event. We will have materials and also have refreshments. We will create another event for you to sign up for this activity.

Elon Musk is attempting a hostile government takeover.
Let's hit him where it hurts—his wallet.

DID YOU KNOW?
- Elon Musk is using his unelected political position to loot our government, demolish lifesaving services, and make himself richer.
- Musk and his cronies at DOGE have taken control of the Treasury, Social Security, and other departments with no governmental authority. He is baselessly firing thousands of federal workers, stealing private data, and gutting our essential infrastructure.
- Musk is a menace and he must be stopped.

WHY TARGET TESLA?
- Much of Musk's inflated wealth is tied up in his stake in Tesla.
- A North American sales collapse would be a disaster for Tesla shareholders, starting with Musk himself, who owns around 13 percent of the company.
- Our protests are already damaging Tesla's sales and reputation. Join us! Let's take back our democracy from billionaires. Text MUSK to 51905.

NO ONE VOTED FOR THIS.
Join the movement.
Text MUSK to 51905.

About this event
Right wing politicians in Washington are moving forward with devastating proposals to cut $2 trillion in Medicaid, housing, food assistance and other vital programs to fund a massive tax giveaway to the wealthy and corporations.

Our Congressman, Mike Lawler, always chirping about his supposed bipartisanship, votes with MAGA 85% of the time. When he could have stopped it, Lawler cast the deciding vote in the House to move these cuts forward. We’re mad as hell and we’re not gonna take it anymore! It’s time to act and show up together in MIKE LAWLER’S DISTRICT IN WESTCHESTER and tell Congress and the billionaires to stop the cuts!

People over Profit: Billionaires Shouldn’t Rule America  The United States is not a corporation, and our government is not a for-profit enterprise. Elon Musk is not a government official. He’s a billionaire with no accountability to the American people, and nobody voted for him. Our democracy deserves better.  
Musk and Trump will only be defeated by a massive, bipartisan movement of everyday Americans standing up against corruption, authoritarianism, and huge tax breaks for the rich, while fighting for the programs that working people need.  
This is a BIPARTISAN, PEACEFUL Protest No violence or Destruction of Property will be tolerated  
The People over Profit Movement  
Right now, millions of Americans across the political divide are struggling. 60% live paycheck to paycheck, many earn very low wages, and 85 million lack proper health insurance. College is too expensive for young people, a quarter of seniors live on $15,000 a year or less, and childhood poverty is among the highest in the world.

Protest Elon Musk's Illegal Government Takeover

Start: Saturday, March 15, 2025 • 12:00 PM  
Location: Tesla Dealership • 1901 Del Monte Blvd, Seaside, CA 93955 US

We had 50 people there on 3/8, twice as many as the week before. It's a good time and we get a lot of positive feedback from passing cars. It might seem like a small thing but every little bit helps. And it feels good to do something so come on down!

Elon Musk and DOGE are engaged in an administrative coup of the federal government. They have taken control of the federal payment system and are unilaterally suspending funds appropriated by congress, in clear violation of the Constitution.

They have already caused immense harm by dismantling USAID and have set their sights on everything from the FAA to Social Security next. Make no mistake, their end goal is the destruction of the US Federal Government and its ability to check corporate power and provide basic services to citizens.

How this develops in Washington remains to be seen, but as US citizens we can exercise our 1st Amendment right to peacefully protest. Elon Musk's net worth is largely based on Tesla stock, which is currently valued at 20X that of other car companies. Driving down the share price is a direct attack on Elon's power.

This is a non-violent action to raise awareness and help to drive down Tesla stock. We can legally protest on the sidewalk as long as we don't obstruct pedestrian or vehicle traffic. This location has plenty of room on the sidewalk and visibility to passing cars.","The image describes a protest against Elon Musk's perceived illegal government actions, planned for March 15, 2025, at a Tesla Dealership in Seaside, California.

STAND AGAINST THE TYRANNY OF PRESIDENT MUSK!

Billionaire loser Elon Musk is undermining our nation. With every shitpost tweet, every cringey meme, every illegal incursion into federal payment systems, he erodes our democracy for personal gain.

The real threat isn't the ""woke mind virus,"" immigrants, or debates over the legality of comedy —it's him.

Nonviolent protests are erupting nationwide against him and Tesla while he is ravaging our planet and exploiting our people. It's time the Inland Empire stands against ketamine addicted nazis like Elon.

This is an uprising. Join the resistance.

Our nation is under attack from within. The time to yell at the news or tune out the world is over. We need to stand up now or soon, we won’t be able to.

I am asking you all to please join me on Saturdays from 1-3. Bring your best signs and bring friends. It is letting the public know our opposition to this theft of our democracy and the rampant corruption that entails. We can also show our strong opposition to abandoning global friends and surrendering to our enemies.","The flyer is calling for a peaceful protest at a Tesla dealership in Mt.

About this event
While Nick Begich wines and dines at an exclusive Republican dinner, rubbing elbows with the elite, Alaskans are left to deal with the mess he’s making. Chicken Nick recently cut Medicaid which will affect up to 250,000 Alaskans, and even you when our hospitals and care givers that draw much of their revenue from Medicaid. There are even plans to cut Medicare.

That’s why we’re bringing CHICKEN NICK straight to his fancy dinner party! Our very own Chicken Nick (yes, a person in a full chicken suit) will be there to remind everyone that Begich clucks for billionaires, not for you.

And you need to be there, with your signs to oppose any cuts in Medicaid, and generally demand that CHICKEN NICK stand up for Alaskans.

He joined the DOGE Caucus, proving he’s more loyal to Elon Musk and than to Alaskans.

And when it’s time to answer for his actions? He’s too chicken to face the people!

If Begich won’t face Alaskans, we’ll bring the truth to his doorstep. Join us, bring your signs, and let’s make some noise!

About this event
The Trump/Musk team has placed incompetent right wing extremists in the Cabinet and other key leadership positions, where they are following Project 2025's 900 page manual for blowing up the American government. Gone are thousands of civil service workers across the United States and foreign countries, with thousands more to follow. Abruptly fired staff include air traffic controllers and workers at nuclear plants. They're canceling leases for offices nationwide that house Social Security, Indian Health Board, CIA, CDC, NIH, Small Business Administration, Public Defender Service, US Fish and Wildlife, Farm Service Administration, Geological Survey, Mine Safety, FBI, EPA, and countless more programs critical to the functioning of our government and society. They've pulled the plug on all DEIA policies, launched mass deportations, broken the Department of Justice, installed an ""Office of Faith"" in the White House, ransacked the Department of Education, IRS, and Social Security, and removed all guardrails that have kept such abuse of power in check. And that's just a few of their ongoing illegal and unconstitutional ""efficiencies.""

Join us to say NO to the wanton, sadistic, racist, bigoted, and corrupt plans of the Heritage Foundation, an ultraconservative think tank backed by billionaires.","The flyer announces a protest against ""Project 2025"" and the activities of the Heritage Foundation.

""A protest song is a song that's so specific that you cannot mistake it for bullshit"" - Phil Ochs  

For Immediate Release - New York, NY - On Sunday, March 16, 2025, at 5 PM, at the world famous Stonewall Inn in the West Village, Composers Concordance presents Protest Songs. We are living in perilous times, where our freedoms, our democracies, and our artistic expressions are being threatened by far-right radicals and an unhinged dictator wannabe in the White House. This is when artists need to stand up and protest.  

Protest music has a long history in this country, with songs addressing social injustice, war, and civil rights. At this event, we will present brand-new songs of protest at the most fitting location: the Stonewall Inn— the site of the 1969 Stonewall riots, which ignited the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States. The event will feature the Bowers Fader Duo, Laurie Towers/John Pietaro Duo and many composer/performers in works by Lynn Bechtold, Seth Boustead, Frank Brickle, Shanan Estreicher, Gilbert Galindo, Patrick Grant, Eugene W. McBride, Carmen Moore, Gene Pritsker, Carolyn Steinberg, Randall Woolf.","The event titled ""Protest Songs"" is a music event hosted by Composers Concordance and others, taking place on March 16, 2025, at 5 PM. It will be held at the Stonewall Inn in the Village, New York City. The event aims to present new protest songs, reflecting on current social and political issues, at a historic location significant to the LGBTQ+ rights movement. Several musicians and composers will perform."

About this event
Congressman Greg Steube has not scheduled a town hall to meet with his constituents during the upcoming
District Work Period March 13 – 23, so the taxpayers of
his district have organized an Empty Chair town hall.
Come meet other Punta Gorda citizens who are
concerned about what Congress is allowing to take
place in Washington, D.C. We expect a media presence
at the event, so we can send a message to
Congressman Steube about our concerns.

Stop the Duval DOGE process, a probable campaign stunt for political gain that could make haphazard budget cuts to city programs.
We must remind City Council that they already have the legislative power to allocate money. So if it's not right, it's on them. Republicans have had the control of the budget for a long time.
On the federal level DOGE is making cuts before they realize what the agencies and programs do. In consequence, they are really hurting the American people. Duval DOGE can do the same thing to Jacksonville citizens.
Time to make it clear before the rumors grow this is not a mayoral problem.

Home » Press Releases » Learn in My Shoes: Parents of special ed students invite legislators to ‘Learn in My Shoes’

MADISON – A grassroots group of Wisconsin parents will bring a visual reminder to the state Capitol on Wednesday, March 19, to ask state legislators for more funding for special education in the upcoming state budget.

The “Learn in My Shoes” campaign will deliver the stories of students with disabilities from across the state to lawmakers. Each one will be attached to a pair of children’s shoes. One shoe will go to their state representative and the other to the state senator who represents them.

EVENT DETAILS

Date: Wednesday, March 19
Time: 12:30 p.m.
Location: State Capitol, room 400 SE

Visuals: Display of children’s shoes with letters to state legislators attached

Local school districts are only reimbursed for about 30% of special education costs. Since the current state budget passed two years ago, two-thirds of Wisconsin’s 421 school districts have gone to referendum, according to the Wisconsin Public Education Network. Some districts have had multiple referendums.

“This isn’t sustainable for local communities or our kids,” said Tiffany Schanno, a Sheboygan parent who launched the campaign with fellow Grafton parent Melissa Custer. “We are asking our legislators to reimburse local school districts for at least 60% of special education costs.”

BACKGROUND: Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo shows 1 in 5 school referendums held in 2024 could have been avoided if special education costs were fully reimbursed.","The image describes a grassroots event called ""Learn in My Shoes,"" where Wisconsin parents lobby for increased special education funding at the state Capitol on March 19. Participants will display children's shoes with letters to legislators."

NO HATE IN STOCKTON!
GIVE TPUSA THE BOOT!

Turning Point USA is hosting a transphobic speaker on March 19th at University of the Pacific. TPUSA is a campus group known for spreading extremist hate and white supremacist beliefs under a friendly veneer. Its leader, Charlie Kirk, has said that transgender people should be ""dealt with like we did in the 50s and 60s,"" and that the Civil Rights Act was ""a huge mistake."" TPUSA has hosted racist and transphobic speakers including mass shooter Kyle Rittenhouse and continues to work closely with Proud Boys and literal neo-Nazis.

About this event
Colorado students and educators are already being asked to do more with less every year — and now lawmakers are considering even more cuts to public education.

Despite being one of the wealthiest states in the country, Colorado chronically underfunds its public schools by $4,000 to $4,500 per student per year compared to the national average. Now, facing a budget shortfall of more than a billion dollars, we must prevent state legislators from cutting public education funding to balance their budget.

Let’s be clear: A cut is a cut, and students pay the price.

On March 20th, educators, students, families, and community partners from across Colorado will rally at the State Capitol to demand No More Education Cuts and call for the fully funded public schools our students deserve.

Learn more at coloradoea.org/no-more-cuts

Wear your favorite #RedForEd shirt and join us.

About this event
Tom Kean, Jr. pretends he is a moderate Republican, but then hides from his constituents. During this March congressional recess, we will rally outside his offices in Bernardsville to send him a message that we know he is complicit in everything the Trump-Musk administration is doing, including terrible cuts to Medicaid that will affect at least 50,000 of Tom Kean Jr.'s constituents in his district. And his silence as Trump prepares to hand Ukraine over to Putin—although Kean has acted like a Ukraine supporter in the past.

Bring your signs.

Those who wish can come ready to quietly visit his office, one or two at a time.","A rally organized by Indivisible Lambertville New Hope is scheduled to protest against budget cuts by Tom Kean Jr. The event will be held on March 20th from 12 PM to 1 PM. The rally will occur outside Tom Kean Jr.'s office in Bernardsville, with the exact address provided to those who sign up. Participants are encouraged to bring signs."

Viewfinders Sculpture
301 N. Delaware St.

The people will meet up on Mass Ave to stand in solidarity with the transgender community and demand an end to the relentless attacks on trans rights in Indiana. As right-wing politicians push 15 anti-trans bills targeting healthcare, education, sports, and more, we must unite our struggles for LGBTQ liberation, racial justice, gender equality, and workers’ rights into one powerful movement. We can build a future where everyone can live with dignity, safety, and freedom.

We refuse to let the ruling class scapegoat trans people for their failures. Trans rights are human rights, and we will fight to protect them! From healthcare access to education, trans people are under siege, but we know our struggles are interconnected. The same politicians attacking trans rights are also cutting funding for public schools, attacking workers’ unions, and rolling back civil rights protections. We will show them workers cannot be divided.

These attacks include bills like IN HB1041, which bans transgender students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity, and IN HB1341, which prohibits changes to gender markers on birth certificates, denying trans people the right to accurate identification. Meanwhile, IN HB1428 allows healthcare providers to deny care to trans individuals based on “conscience,” and IN SB0479 criminalizes assisting minors in accessing gender-affirming care, threatening families and providers with felony charges. These bills are part of a broader agenda to divide and distract the working class while the billionaire class consolidates power.

Join us as we rally to defend trans rights, resist bigotry, and fight for a future where everyone can thrive.","The image is promoting a rally titled ""Rally: Defend Trans Rights!"" which is scheduled for Thursday, March 20, at 6:00 pm at Viewfinders Sculpture, 301 N.

About this event
Good evening. I am delighted to say that 36 have already signed up for the nonviolent protest outside Tillis' luncheon. Senator Budd is also supposed to be there.

The luncheon starts at 11:30. If folks want to arrive at 11am, you might be able to see him go in (maybe).

Please make signs that say, ""Tillis meet with US"" and
""Billionaires are not US"" ""Tillis Stand Up!""

Parking on Argyle and Lakeview would be convenient. There is room on the grassy strip in front of the country club on Glenwood Ave.

Gene and Rebekah will be there to answer any questions as I cannot be there.

Thanks so much!

About this event
Join Us: March for Rights, Democracy, and a Stronger, United Community.

On Friday, March 21st, at noon, we will gather at the state Capitol building to advocate for our rights. Together, we'll advocate for democracy, justice, and a future where everyone's rights are protected. Celebrate International Women's Month by marching for the People!

The stakes are high, and our collective action matters. Bring your family, friends, energy, signs, and noisemakers. Democracy thrives when we show up. This is about standing together for a government representing the people, not unchecked power.

Inspirational Speakers: Hear from President Richard Peterson, Central Council Tlingit & Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska, and other local leaders.

We're leading a peaceful demonstration on the sidewalk, ONLY, outside of the Mechanicsburg, PA, Tesla dealership to let the community know that supporting Tesla is bad for democracy, and to remind our entire community that Elon Musk's lawless actions are dangerous and won't be tolerated.

Musk is seizing control of the US Government and needs to be stopped. Join us as we stand up and speak out in defense of Democratic principles and institutions.

Tesla stores are owned by the company, so we are not impacting a small business.

There will be some signs available. You may also bring your own signs encouraging people to honk for democracy and sharing your thoughts about Elon's destruction of our government.

DO NOT PARK ON TESLA PROPERTY! Nearby large lots we recommend are Aldi’s, Appalachian Brewery, the ABC Bowling Alley, or taking a right onto Sample Bridge Rd and parking in the residential area. Carpooling is encouraged.

This is a peaceful action. We will not enter the business, nor harass or stop people from entering or exiting the property. No violence or threats against anyone will be tolerated.","A peaceful protest named ""RECALL MUSK! Peaceful Protest!"" is scheduled on Friday, March 21, 2025, from 4 PM to 6 PM at 6458 Carlisle Pike, Mechanicsburg, PA. The event is organized by the PA 10th District Network. The protest aims to demonstrate opposition to Tesla and Elon Musk, emphasizing lawless actions and defending democratic principles. Participants are encouraged to bring signs. Parking is advised in nearby lots, and carpooling is encouraged. It's a non-violent demonstration."

About this event
Association for Mature American Citizens is having their first chapter meeting at the King City Clubhouse.
Why is this important?
1. Michael Stettler, State Director of United Sovereign Americans (USA), will be a speaker there. This organization aims to build distrust in elections, file anti-voting lawsuits against elections they don’t like, and have been in trouble for intimidating people door-to-door asking about their voting status.
2. Donna Kreitzberg, Executive Director of Education Freedom, will be a speaker there. Education Freedom advocates for a school voucher program which would divert public funding from schools, widen educational inequality, lacks accountability and oversight, and would increase racial, economic, and religious segregation.
3. Kristen Christensen, State Director of Heritage Action for America, will be a speaker there. They are a sister organization to The Heritage Foundation—Project 2025.
4. Lincoln Casarez, State Director of Turning Point USA, will be a speaker there. They are known for spreading misinformation about history, elections, climate change, and social issues along with extremist rhetoric. They specifically go out and target college professors on their “hit lists”, undermine higher education and intellectual discourse and use disruptive or aggressive tactics staging confrontational stunts on college campuses for “gotcha” moments. They have also been called out for their sexist, racist, and xenophobic remarks.
We will likely need to protest on the street. Hope to see you there!

About this event
After spending over $250 million to help elect Donald Trump, Elon Musk is now collecting on his investment. The world’s richest man isn’t just enabling Trump—he’s an unelected billionaire seizing control of government power for his own gain.
To fight back, we have to meet Musk where he operates. A Tesla protest is a powerful way to expose his deep ties to the Trump coup and demand accountability.
📍 Where: 21030 N 19th Ave Phoenix, AZ 85027
📅 When: Friday, February 21st, at 11:00am
Stay on Message: This is about Musk’s political takeover, not Tesla, SpaceX, or X as companies.

No one elected Elon Musk, but he is harassing thousands of federal workers, and has access to all of our personal information with zero oversight. This is an unprecedented takeover of our federal government by an unelected billionaire! Bring your friends and some signs, and join our peaceful protest at the Savannah Tesla showroom.

⚡ Sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines.

⚡ Hurting Tesla is stopping Musk.

⚡ Stopping Musk will help save lives and our democracy.

To Protect National Parks
Saturday at Noon
at a National Park Near You

resistancerangers You ready for round two?! Protect the Parks Protest is back! This Saturday, March 22 — show up to support your closest national park site. Can we get someone at all 433 NPS units??

How you protest can look a lot of ways — just showing up is fantastic! But we’re suggesting a rally and teach-in: let’s tell stories about public lands and why they matter, then take action!

Teach each other how to contact your reps, then take turns calling. Set up some stations: postcard writing, calling, emailing, etc! Learn something new about your park site and teach the group.

There are MANY ways to protest, so do anything that reminds us that public lands are for the people… not billionaires!

Just remember — be respectful to the rangers and the park site. Leave no trace, and keep it nonviolent. Let’s get creative!

Check the link in our bio for protest locations and resources. Park/location not on the list? You can organize it — because you learned how last time! DM us and we’ll add your site.

Stay tuned for more details!

Fascist manchild Elon Musk is mad that our Tesla Takedown movement is successfully tanking his stock value. Now he and his allies are throwing a tantrum and attempting to silence organizers fighting back against his takeover of the US government - boo hoo!
Elon donated $250 million to Trump's campaign to purchase – and tank – the federal government. He's slashing critical services. He's gutting federal agencies that protect our food and health. Many, many people will die because of Elon's actions.
Nazis Elon and Trump should know that wannabe dictators who dismantle our government will be resisted and defeated. As we write, they are undermining the rule of law to disappear Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent resident, for exercising his right to free speech. This is attempted authoritarianism. Elon is an outright fascist who will take any opportunity to sacrifice human well-being so he can hoard power and money.
What we're doing is working. We are tanking Elon's wealth. We won't back down.

Join us to make this the largest NYC Tesla Takedown action yet — and show that Elon's stunts will mean even more of us will rise up!","The flyer promotes the ""Tesla Takedown NYC"" event on March 22, 2025, at 12:00 PM at the Tesla Showroom in New York City.

🌲 SINCE YOU ASKED FOR MORE 🌲

📢 First and foremost — PLEASE SHARE. So many were disappointed they couldn't attend the last one because they didn't know in time.

🗓 Going to attend one? Let us know which one below.

🌲 You ready for round two?! Protect the Parks Protest is back! This Saturday, March 22 - show up to support your closest national park site. Can we get someone at all 433 NPS units??

➡️ How you protest can look a lot of ways - just showing up is fantastic! But we're suggesting a rally and teach-in: let's tell stories about public lands and why they matter, then take action!

📱 Teach each other how to contact your reps, then take turns calling. Set up some stations: postcard writing, calling, emailing, etc! Learn something new about your park site and teach the group.

💰 There are MANY ways to protest, so do anything that reminds us that public lands are for the people... not billionaires!

🌿 Just remember - be respectful to the rangers and the park site. Leave no trace, and keep it nonviolent. Let's get creative!

➤ Check the link in our bio (@resistancerangers) for protest locations and resources. Park/location not on the list? You can organize it - because you learned how last time! DM us (@resistancerangers) and we'll add your site.

Stay tuned for more details!

The 295,000 active and retired members of the National Association of Letter Carriers have a message to deliver: Hands off the Postal Service.

ANY EFFORT TO PRIVATIZE OR RESTRUCTURE USPS IS A DIRECT THREAT TO:
- 640,000 postal employees, including 200,000 city letter carriers represented by NALC
- The universal service every American relies on
- Millions of households and businesses, especially in rural America

THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE DEVASTATING:
- Jeopardizing the jobs of the 7.9 million people employed by the $1.2 trillion mailing industry
- Reducing services to 51.5 million households and businesses in rural communities, where private carriers do not deliver
- Raising shipping costs and driving inflation higher for businesses and consumers

SUCH PROPOSALS ARE ILLEGAL AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL:
- The Postal Service, older than our nation itself, is enshrined in the Constitution.
- The Constitution gives Congress, not the president, a key role in setting postal policy.
- Americans have easy access to the most affordable, independent, self-sufficient agency for 55 cents

WHY WE’RE FIGHTING:
- To protect and uplift 640,000 USPS employees, including 73,000 veterans
- To uphold our universal service obligation, delivering 376 million pieces of mail and packages to over 153 million addresses nationwide
- To oppose privatization of the nation’s most trusted public agencies
- To oppose privatization of jobs or reorganizational mandates that would threaten the safety of our workforce

• Universal service has been and remains an independent, self-sufficient agency for 55 years

WHY WE'RE FIGHTING:
• To protect the jobs of 640,000 USPS employees, including 73,000 veterans
• To uphold our universal service obligation, delivering 376 million pieces of mail and packages daily to 157 million delivery points nationwide
• To preserve America’s Postal Service, one of the nation’s most trusted public agencies
• To oppose privatization efforts or reorganizational mandates that would threaten the service we provide

March 23rd, 11am, Window on the Bay, Monterey.

About this event
Sunday, March 23, 12:00 PM: The Postal Service is facing one of the most serious threats in our history. Reports indicate that the new presidential administration is preparing an illegal and hostile takeover of the USPS, threatening the stability of our jobs, our workplaces, and the public service we proudly provide. The American people deserve a Postal Service that remains true to its public mission and continues to serve communities across the country, no matter where you live. Now postal workers and the communities we serve are standing together to ensure our postal service stays in the hands of the people, not the billionaires. Let's make it clear to the country that the U.S. Mail is Not For Sale!

Are you sick and tired of fascism in America? Exhausted from Trump and Musk and the never-ending breaking news cycle of insanity? Exercising your first amendment rights is a great way to fight back!

Join us on Sunday, March 23, 2025 in Rochester Hills on the Northeast corner of Walton and Livernois from 2pm-4pm (or until we all want to go home).
**weather and side walk conditions permitting**
**this is a sidewalk demonstration NOT a march**
**All are welcome including children, HOWEVER, this is a protest off of a main road, this environment may not be safe or suitable for all children, we are not responsible for you or your child's safety. If this environment isn't suitable for them please do not bring them**
**This is a public sidewalk so while I cannot tell people not to bring their animals, I would highly discourage it. Again this is a protest off a main road, I do not want anyone's pet to get scared and/or hurt (I'm not talking about service animals)**
**Masking is not required, but highly encouraged**
**This is a peaceful protest**

Bring signs that support any human rights causes or that oppose fascism and the current administration!

We have snacks, water, extra signs, and hand warmers if it's cold! We are building anti fascist community both on social media and in person, if you have not already joined our Antifascist group please feel free to do so!

PROTECT DEMOCRACY!

HARRISBURG STATE CAPITOL

LEARN MORE AT MOHPA.ORG/EVENTS

No town halls? No replies? We're going to Harrisburg and confronting Legislators face-to-face.

Calls, letters, and Zoom meetings with elected officials have their place, and we've done plenty of them. But there's nothing quite like looking a shifty politician in the eye and asking a straightforward, no-nonsense question.

This Monday, March 24th, we are going to the Capitol and we are bringing our video equipment. After months of inaction from the House and Senate, we need you to join us as we escalate the pressure. We're going to send a message to both Democrat and GOP leadership that we are not giving up our fight to convince our state government to do the right thing: take a stand against corruption and Pass a Gift Ban.

If you've ever wanted to be a little more direct with our frozen, corporate-indentured ""leaders"" in Harrisburg, come and join us on 3/24. This is a non-arrestable action.

Let's keep the momentum going! we've had such an amazing event with 350 people in attendance last week, let's do it again!

Elon Musk is stealing our democracy, our data, & our money.

Musk and his lawless engineers have gained access to Treasury, Health & Human Services, OPM, Dept of Education...More every day! With Trump's POWER GRAB, they and their crony oligarchs are infiltrating our government to increase their power and their wealth by 4 trillion dollars- STEALING OUR MONEY.

Tesla is the closest thing we have in Portland to Elon, so let us peacefully protest in the right of way/sidewalk in front of the Portland dealership to increase visibility of this issue.

Meet us at Old Spaghetti Factory, where we will walk over at 3:45pm *sharp* as a group or meet us at Tesla at 4pm. We'll be there during rush hour for prime visibility, ending at around 5:15. Parking is $5/hr at the OSP or on street parking for $2.50/hr. Highly recommend taking public transportation or carpooling.","The flyer promotes a peaceful protest event in front of Portland's Tesla dealership.

About this event
Mahmoud Kahlil is a Columbia graduate student, green card holder and is married to a US citizen. Yet he was picked up by ICE, illegally transported to a Louisiana and threatened with deportation. He has committed no crime but was targeted because of his religion (Muslim) and because he spoke passionately about the need to end the war in Gaza and respect Palestinian rights! If they can do this to Mahmoud - they can do this to anyone! We will be gathering at 11:00am at the US courthouse to show our support for Kahlil and the Rule of law! The US courthouse is located at 50 Walnut Street in Newark. We will be joined in Newark by our brothers and sisters in the People's Organization for Progress and Refuse Fascism.org","The image promotes a rally event titled ""In the name of Humanity - Free Mahmoud Kahlil NOW!"" hosted by the Tom Paine Brigade.

About this event
Illinois Senator Dick Durbin was one of 10 Democratic Senators who provided the essential votes needed to pass the Republican government funding bill. With his vote, Durbin helped give up one of the last pieces of leverage to slow the MAGA agenda, while increasing funding for deportations and giving Trump and Elon more control over government spending.

Durbin has clearly shown which side he's on: he’s on the side of oligarchy, billionaires, and polluters. We deserve a government for the people and the planet, not billionaires and corporations. Let's fight for it!","The image is an announcement for a rally against Senator Durbin's actions related to the MAGA agenda, hosted by the Sunrise Movement, scheduled to take place at Senator Durbin's office in Chicago."

Billions of federal dollars dedicated to our budgets funneled to the private sector at a higher rate to the taxpayers due to a lack of workers with specialized knowledge.

Welcome to Rochester's first anti-Tesla, anti-Musk protest!

You're probably wondering why this is on a Friday and not a Saturday. Well, this particular Tesla store is closed on Saturdays. To disturb as much of their operations and customer flow as possible, it's important we do this during business hours.

We (your organizers) will be bringing plenty of signs, but please bring your own! Ideas include:  
- Honk if you hate Musk  
- Say no to Swastikars  
- No Tesla, More Peace  
- Divest Tesla  
- How fast does Tesla go from 0 to 1939?  
- Stop Musk (with a swastika as the S in Musk)  
- Delete DOGE  

That's just a start, there are so many other options!

We're lucky that they've put the store in such a high traffic location, and a Friday rush hour is the perfect...","This flyer announces the ""Tesla Takedown Rochester NY,"" scheduled for March 28, 2025, from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM at Tesla Rochester in Rochester, NY.

Join us this Land Day — March 30th at 12 PM — for a powerful march and rally!

On March 30, 1976, Palestinians rose up in protest against Israel’s theft of thousands of acres of land in the Galilee. Six Palestinians were killed, hundreds injured, and countless more arrested — but their resistance sparked a movement that lives on.

Today, that struggle continues. From the ongoing genocide in Gaza to the relentless settler violence and land seizures in the West Bank, Palestinians are fighting for survival against a system of apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and dispossession.

Land Day is a historically significant day each year marking the heroic resistance of Palestinians in 1976, when in response to an Israeli land grab Palestinians rose up and organized coordinated resistance in the form of strikes and massive marches.
In the face of the violated ceasefire and the continuing genocide of Palestine, it has never been more important that we take to the streets and demand the right of Palestinians to self determination. Join us!

WE ARE NOT FOOLS
This is not an April Fools joke. 🙂. In protest of the wide variety of Trump–Musk led anti-democratic activities that are occurring, I decided to organize a motorcoach protest trip to NC Senators Tillis and Budd’s Raleigh field offices. I’m calling it my “We Are Not Fools” protest. In only 2 days I filled a 50 person motor coach with friends and neighbors who want to be heard. It is a long shot to expect a meeting with a Senator. I’m hopeful for a meeting with staff. I won’t be surprised if neither occurs and we have a walking protest.
You can do it too! Help support this idea. On April 1st call or visit your respective Republican Senator and Representatives offices and tell them in no uncertain term that you will not be treated as a fool any longer. Tell them that you vote. Tell them that you will hold them accountable for the Trump – Musk anti-democracy actions that are occurring. Drive your car, charter a bus (like me), walk, ride a bike. Make your voice heard. Be prepared, be peaceful, be persistent.
On this April Fools Day tell Republicans that you are not a fool and that you will NOT BE FOOLED any longer.
We have power. USE IT.

About this event
Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them. Tampa is fighting back!

They're taking everything they can get their hands on—our health care, our data, our jobs, our services—and daring the world to stop them. This is a crisis, and the time to act is now.

On Saturday, April 5th, we're taking to the streets to fight back with a clear message: Hands off!

Where: Tampa City Hall - E Kennedy Blvd, 315 E Kennedy Blvd Tampa, FL 33602 When: 9 am April 5, 2025

This mass mobilization day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies. Alongside Americans across the country, we are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop the chaos and build an opposition movement against the looting of our country.

A core principle behind all Hands Off! events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

About this event
Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them. We are fighting back!

They're taking everything they can get their hands on—our health care, our data, our jobs, our services—and daring the world to stop them. This is a crisis, and the time to act is now.

🚨 On Saturday, April 5th, we're taking to the streets to fight back with a clear message: Hands off! 🚨

This mass mobilization day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies. Alongside Americans across the country, we are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop the chaos and build an opposition movement against the looting of our country.

A core principle behind all Hands Off! events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

Hands Off! Monterey Fights Back
Rally · Volunteer organized

📅 Saturday, April 5
🕒 11am – 1pm PDT

📍 Window on the Bay
717 Del Monte Ave
Monterey, CA 93940
 Map

About this event:
Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them. Monterey is fighting back!

They're taking everything they can get their hands on—our health care, our data, our jobs, our services—and daring the world to stop them. This is a crisis, and the time to act is now.

📷 On Saturday, April 5th, we're taking to the streets to fight back with a clear message: Hands off! 📷

📌 Where: Window on the Bay 717 Del Monte Ave, Monterey, CA 93940 📆 When: 11-1p.m. April 5, 2025

This mass mobilization day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies. Alongside Americans across the country, we are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop to the chaos and build an opposition movement against the looting of our country.

A core principle behind all Hands Off! events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

About this event
Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them. New York City is fighting back!

They're taking everything they can get their hands on—our health care, our data, our jobs, our services—and daring the world to stop them. This is a crisis, and the time to act is now.

🚨 On Saturday, April 5th, we're taking to the streets to fight back with a clear message: Hands off! 🚨

📍 Where: Manhattan, final location TBD 📅 When: April 5, 2025

This mass mobilization day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies. Alongside Americans across the country, we are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop the chaos and build an opposition movement against the looting of our country.

A core principle behind all Hands Off! events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

About this event
Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them. Redwood City is fighting back!

They're taking everything they can get their hands on—our health care, our data, our jobs, our services—and daring the world to stop them. This is a crisis, and the time to act is now.

On Saturday, April 5th, we're taking to the streets to fight back with a clear message: Hands off!

📍 Where: Corner of Jefferson Ave and El Camino Real
📅 When: 12 - 1:30 pm April 5, 2025

This mass mobilization day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies. Alongside Americans across the country, we are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop the chaos and build an opposition movement against the looting of our country.

A core principle behind all Hands Off! events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

About this event
Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them. The South Bay is fighting back!

They're taking everything they can get their hands on—our health care, our data, our jobs, our services—and daring the world to stop them. This is a crisis, and the time to act is now.

📅 On Saturday, April 5th, we're taking to the streets to fight back with a clear message: Hands off!

📍 Where: Torrance City Hall, 📅 When: 12-2 pm April 5, 2025

This mass mobilization day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies. Alongside Americans across the country, we are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop the chaos and build an opposition movement against the looting of our country.

A core principle behind all Hands Off! events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them. Plymouth is fighting back!
They're taking everything they can get their hands on—our health care, our data, our jobs, our services—and daring the world to stop them. This is a crisis, and the time to act is now.

On Saturday, April 5th, we'll Fill the Hill to fight back with a clear message: Hands off!
📍 Where: Coles Hill, Water Street, Plymouth, MA 📅 When: noon, April 5, 2025

About this event
Join Indivisible Twin Cities, 50501MN and Women's March MN at the MN State Capitol on April 5, when national and local organizations are coming together across the country to organize for Hands Off!, a national mass activation in defiance of the Trump-Musk billionaire takeover and the Republican assault on our freedoms and our communities. Hands Off! is an all-in moment for the pro-democracy, pro-worker movement—a demand, a warning, and a rallying cry that responds to the primary reasons for our mobilization:

- Trump and Musk are attempting an illegal power grab is a crisis we must stop.
- Trump, Musk, and congressional Republicans are gutting services, raising prices, and racing towards slashing Medicaid, Social Security, and more.
- Trump, Musk, and congressional Republicans are on this path of destruction for the benefit of their billionaire allies.

Whether you are mobilized by the attacks on our democracy, the slashing of jobs, the invasion of privacy, or the assault on our services—this moment is for you. We'll be part of a massive, visible, national rejection of this crisis. Our goal is to show that the people—the majority— are taking action to stop the corruption and power grab.

Bring your signs, and meet us for this inspiring, peaceful, and mobilizing show of solidarity.

About this event

Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them.
They’re taking everything they can get their hands on—our health care, our data, our jobs, our services—and daring the world to stop them. This is a crisis, and the time to act is now.

On Saturday, April 5th, we’re taking to the streets in Washington, D.C. to send a clear message: Hands off! 
📍 Where: Sylvan Theater, National Mall, Washington, D.C. 
🗓️ When: 1:00 PM, April 5, 2025

This mass mobilization day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies. Alongside Americans across the country, we are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop the chaos and build an opposition movement against the looting of our country.

A core principle behind all Hands Off! events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

WE THE PEOPLE DEMAND...
REMOVE
- We the people demand that the offending elected officials be removed from office. President Donald Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance, and all cabinet officials appointed since January 20, 2025, must resign or be impeached and removed by Congress.

REVERSE
- We the people demand that all executive orders issued since January 20, 2025, be fully reversed. D.O.G.E. and Elon Musk must be removed from influence in government, and illegally fired federal employees must be reinstated to their former positions with back pay.

RECLAIM
- We the people demand that government work for us. We demand a government of the people, by the people, and for the people — not the billionaire class. Therefore, Citizens United must be overturned — by Supreme Court decision or Constitutional Amendment — and followed by aggressive campaign finance reform designed to give all Americans a fair voice in government. Executive overreach must be controlled by both the Legislature and the Judiciary, so we are never again ruled by kings.","The poster announces a nationwide protest on April 5th, 2025, part of a movement involving 50 states. The event begins at Piedmont Park in Atlanta, GA, with a march to the State Capitol. It demands several political actions related to government and legislative reforms."

About this event

Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them. Syracuse is fighting back!

They're taking everything they can get their hands on — our health care, our data, our jobs, our services — and daring the world to stop them. This is a crisis, and the time to act is now.

On Saturday, April 5th, we're taking to the streets to fight back with a clear message: Hands off!

📍 Where: Forman Park 🗓 When: 1 pm April 5, 2025

This mass mobilization day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies. Alongside Americans across the country, we are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop the chaos and build an opposition movement against the looting of our country.

A core principle behind all Hands Off! events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

About this event

Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them. Hartford is fighting back!

They're taking everything they can get their hands on—our health care, our data, our jobs, our services—and daring the world to stop them. This is a crisis, and the time to act is now.

📍 On Saturday, April 5th, we're taking to the streets to fight back with a clear message: Hands off! 📍
📍 Where: Connecticut State Capitol 📅 When: 3-6 pm April 5, 2025

This mass mobilization day is our message to the world: we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies. Alongside Americans across the country, we are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop the chaos and build an opposition movement against the looting of our country.

A core principle behind all Hands Off! events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

Robert Reich: Plan to Resist Trump’s Tyranny on April 19

Posted by dianeravitch

Robert Reich is a relentless fighter for our democracy. He served in the administrations of Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton, in whose administration he was secretary of Labor.

He wrote recently to urge people to organize against Trump’s violations of the law.

Friends,

Before I post my Sunday cartoon, I want to share with you some thoughts about the third hellish week of Trump II.","The image is a section from Diane Ravitch's blog discussing Robert Reich's plan to resist what is described as Trump's tyranny, mentioning an event taking place on April 19. It highlights Reich as a staunch defender of democracy and includes a call to action for people to organize against violations of the law."

RALLY TO SAVE USPS

The 295,000 active and retired members of the National Association of Letter Carriers have a message to deliver: Hands off the Postal Service.

ANY EFFORT TO PRIVATIZE OR RESTRUCTURE USPS IS A DIRECT THREAT TO:
• 640,000 postal employees, including 200,000 city letter carriers represented by NALC
• The universal service every American relies on
• Millions of households and businesses, especially in rural America

THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE DEVASTATING:
• Jeopardizing the jobs of the 7.9 million people employed by the $1.92 trillion mailing industry
• Reducing services to 51.5 million households and businesses in rural communities, where private carriers do not deliver
• Raising shipping costs and driving inflation higher for businesses and consumers

SUCH PROPOSALS ARE ILLEGAL AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL:
• The Postal Service, older than our nation itself, is enshrined in the Constitution.
• The Constitution gives Congress, not the president, a key role in setting postal policy.
• Mandated by federal law, USPS has been an independent, self-sufficient agency for 55 years.

WHY WE’RE FIGHTING:
• To protect the jobs of 640,000 USPS employees, including 73,000 veterans
• To uphold our universal service obligation, delivering 376 million pieces of mail and packages to nearly 169 million delivery points nationwide
• To safeguard USPS, one of the nation’s most trusted public agencies
• To oppose privatization efforts or reorganizational mandates that would threaten the Postal Service and our jobs

FIGHT LIKE HELL!","The flyer advocates against the privatization or restructuring of USPS, arguing it threatens postal employees, universal service, and rural communities. It highlights devastating consequences, including job losses and increased costs. The effort is seen as unconstitutional, and the campaign aims to protect USPS jobs and services."

About this event
COVA Coalition and friends Indivisible, Red Wine and Blue, Community Circles, Network NOVA, Virginia Grassroots and our allies and activists are JOINING FORCES to say ""hands off"" our freedoms and liberties.
The right wing extremists are allowing Trump, Elon and their cronies take everything they can get their hands on—our health care, our data, our jobs, our services—and daring the world to stop them. This is a crisis, and the time to act is now.
🚨 On Saturday, April 5th, we have a clear message: Hands off! 🚨
This mass mobilization day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies. Alongside Americans across the country, we are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop the chaos and build an opposition movement against the looting of our country.
A core principle behind all Hands Off! events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

Join Us!!!! All are Welcome!!!!

About: We are South County Citizens who are concerned about the anti-democratic and illegal actions of the Trump administration. We believe in freedom of speech and in peaceful acts of protest and civil disobedience. We witness, with growing alarm, how our constitutional rights are trampled upon, how the authority of the President is being usurped by those who seek to consolidate power for personal gain. We will not remain silent as President Trump systematically dismantles the guardrails designed to ensure accountability across the branches of government.

Join Us: Facebook South County Resistance group page Bluesky South County Resistance","The image describes a protest event organized by South County Resistance, occurring on April 5, 2025, in Wakefield. It’s aimed at expressing dissent towards Trump and Musk, highlighting the phrase ""HANDS OFF our democracy."" Participants are encouraged to bring signs and gather at the bike path.

On March 4, 2025, a memo written by VA Chief of Staff Christopher Syrek was made public, describing plans to lay off more than 80,000 Veterans Affairs employees across the country. VA Secretary Doug Collins later confirmed this plan to the press and intends to begin cutting jobs as soon as August. This represents an unacceptable attack on veterans, nurses, and all other VA staff! Nurses and our allies in Durham are rallying to say no cuts to our VA!

About this event

Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them. We are fighting back!

They're taking everything they can get their hands on—our health care, our data, our jobs, our services—and daring the world to stop them. This is a crisis, and the time to act is now.

On Saturday, April 5th, Indivisible Riverside is taking to the streets to fight back with a clear message: Hands off!

Where: Downtown Riverside When: 6:30pm to 8pm in the evening, April 5, 2025

This is an evening event and will include lighted letter boards to spell 'hands off' or other messaging.

This mass mobilization day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies. Alongside Americans across the country, we are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop the chaos and build an opposition movement against the looting of our country.

A core principle behind all Hands Off! events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

About this event
Join NJ50501 for our next Day of Action!
Saturday, April 19th, at 12 PM
📍 The plaza between the State House Annex and the New Jersey State Library

We’re deeply grateful to everyone who joined us at our last rally—your passion and energy proved our movement is growing and we’re not alone in this fight.

This rally falls on the anniversary of the Battle of Lexington and Concord, a historic reminder of resistance to tyranny. Together, we’ll protest:
- The Trump administration’s abuse of executive power, including its attacks on congressional authority, judicial independence, and the separation of powers.
- The SAVE Act, a voter suppression bill targeting women and low-income Americans.
- The potential misuse of the Insurrection Act of 1807, which could criminalize peaceful protest and undermine First Amendment rights.

These threats are real—and they demand action. We remain committed to peaceful protest, grassroots organizing, and defending those most at risk.
📥 Food Drive
Bring non-perishable food items (no glass or cans) to support our community.

About this event
This a local Indivisible event!

No one voted for Elon Musk but he's using his wealth and power to destroy vital government agencies and indispensable social programs. His heartless agenda will harm regular folks across the country in order to fund tax breaks for billionaires. So let’s show up at Elon’s business to tell him “HANDS OFF!”.

Please note the following-
Meet and stay on the sidewalk in front of the Tesla Dealership. Use care if you need to cross Route 35.
Bring your instruments, noisemakers, signs and American flags. Ignore counter protesters.
Remember: This is intended to be a peaceful rally. Do not bother Tesla employees or customers.

Activism is personal. After doing your own research, decide whether this action is right for you.","The image describes a rally event titled 'Tesla Takedown with Jersey Shore Blue' happening on Saturdays from 12:00 PM to 1:30 PM EDT at a Tesla Dealership in Eatontown, NJ.

Protest at Tesla Paramus, NJ

Elon Musk is destroying our democracy, and he's using the fortune he built at Tesla to do it. We are taking nonviolent action at Tesla to stop Musk's illegal coup.
Sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines.
We're tanking Tesla's stock price to stop Musk.
Stopping Musk will help save lives and protect our democracy.

The stakes couldn’t be higher. No one is coming to save us. Not politicians, not the media, not the courts.

Tesla Takedown is a peaceful protest movement. We oppose violence, vandalism and destruction of property. This protest is a lawful exercise of our First Amendment right to peaceful assembly.

Notes:
- Please be aware that Home Depot has indicated that it may tow cars. Be mindful of where you choose to park as it is at your own risk.
- Bring your signs and chants!
- Please keep safety in mind.
- Please no loud siren sounds or air horns.
- The route 17 location is not suitable for children.
- Please do not walk through the bushes on-site.
- Have fun!

You don't have to RSVP, but it does help us gauge attendance and keeps you informed about future Paramus Tesla Takedown dates or any weather-related changes.

Congressional Representative Marcy Kaptur Ohio district 9 currently in her 22nd term

Marcy Kaptur has gone against the people’ interest for far too long. Recently Representative Kaptur voted to censure Representative Al Green, for standing up and speaking out against Trump at an address to a joint session of Congress last month. She has been a member of Congress since 1983, and we are sick of her outdated views!

Immigrant workers are going missing, being disappeared in broad daylight by the modern American gestapo called ICE. Enemies of state? No, regular people like you and me being dehumanized for profit and political gain.
An injury to one is an injury to us all!
Whose name will be next on Trump’s list of “undesirables”?
Meanwhile, federal workers of essential programs are recklessly dismissed - The workforces of the National Labor Relations Board, The Department of Labor and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have been slashed, threatening the livelihood of millions and plunging our country into chaos. Child labor laws are being repealed under the guise of freedom. Why is this happening? To strengthen the working class? No, to pad their bottom line and increase their profits!
Project 2025 seeks to defund the National Labor Relations Board and the Department of Labor to make it easier for businesses to exploit you, the worker.
Will you silently comply, hoping it all works out? Will you watch your coworkers and friends be disappeared and do nothing? Or will you speak up, show up, and take your power back? Resist exploitation and oppression! Workers unite! Defend your rights!

WORKER SAFETY UNDER ATTACK: STORIES FROM THE FIGHTBACK

Workshop presented by The Health and Safety Committee of the Arizona Jobs with Justice Coalition

Saturday, April 26th 4:00 to 5:30 pm Salt of the Earth Labor College 1902 E. Irene Vista in Tucson Please note the time change from our usual

Worker safety was the major story of the COVID pandemic. Essential workers were thrown into deadly danger to service the rest of us - without protections! Eventually workers organized in ways never seen before - organizing campaigns led by workers started happening in Starbucks, Amazon and the agro-industry. Public support for workers & unions reached an all-time high Point.

The first Trump administration forced meatpacking workers back to the job in spite of deadly conditions in the food factories. The many botched policies related to the pandemic made the US the butt joke for the rest of the world. Unions gained more power to protect its members and build strong alliances with unorganized workers.

Safety has come a long way. Its ability to organize and fight corporate overreach is huge. Which is why it's under attack. We must demand HANDS OFF of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA). We also need to protect injured workers' rights to proper healthcare, disability insurance(SDI), Medicaid, and a National Labor Relations Board that protects their right to unionize. It took decades of struggle for working people to win some protections from greedy corporate bosses. We need to protest. We need to organize. We need more creative ways to struggle.

Come hear testimonies of workers and advocates for lifting up worker safety. The end of April is the time of year to call attention to workplace safety. Arizona loses a hundred workers per year to traumatic fatal deaths. An estimated two thousand workers die from exposure to health hazards such as heat or chemical exposure. Tens of thousands are seriously injured by work - often to be challenged and degraded by a Worker compensation system that devalues them and treats them like trash.

There’s no a better issue for workers to organize around - come hear how it works

About this event
Across the country—from fruit fields in California to classrooms in Chicago, from kitchens in Queens to loading docks in Atlanta—working people are rising up. We are demanding a country that puts our families over their fortunes—public schools over private profits, healthcare over hedge funds, housing over homelessness.

Musk, Trump and their fellow profiteers are trying to create a race to the bottom—on wages, on benefits, on dignity itself. They want to erase labor rights, break our unions, and silence immigrant voices.

May Day 2025 we are fighting back. Organizing for a world where every family has housing, healthcare, fair wages, union protection, and safety—regardless of race, zip code, or immigration status.

They're defunding our schools, privatizing public services, attacking unions, and targeting immigrant families with fear and violence. This is a war on working people, and we will not stand down. This day of action is just the beginning. We're organizing not just for one day, but to build power in every neighborhood, on every shop floor, and in every school.

Family-friendly sign-making
Community building and networking
Learn how to support public research
WHY WE’RE DOING THIS:
This is a joyful event — a chance to show what we value and what we’re building. While NIH is being forced to walk away from science, we’re doubling down on it — showing our kids and our community that science is for everyone, and the future is worth fighting for.

About this event
Across the country—from fruit fields in California to classrooms in Chicago, from kitchens in Queens to loading docks in Atlanta—working people are rising up. We are demanding a country that puts our families over their fortunes—public schools over private profits, healthcare over hedge funds, housing over homelessness.

Musk, Trump and their fellow profiteers are trying to create a race to the bottom—on wages, on benefits, on dignity itself. They want to erase labor rights, break our unions, and silence immigrant voices.

May Day 2025 we are standing united. We're organizing for a world where every family has housing, healthcare, fair wages, union protection, and safety—regardless of race, zip code, or immigration status.

They’re defunding our schools, privatizing public services, attacking unions, and targeting immigrant families with fear and violence. This is a war on working people—and we will not stand down. Using the principles of nonviolence and peaceful protest, we will stand together and stand strong.

This May Day, we will turn the page. This is the beginning of a new era—one where working families lead, immigrants are protected, and no one is left behind. This is not charity. This is not a request. We are reclaiming our power from corporate elites, and we will not be intimidated by Trump, Musk, or their billionaire backers. They’ve ruled for too long. Their time is up.

STOP THE BILLIONAIRE TAKEOVER. WE ARE THE MANY. THEY ARE THE FEW. THIS IS MAY DAY. JOIN NJ50501.

We rank and file members of the Education Association of Passaic decided on the Passaic BOE as a target because with an upcoming contract fight and proposed cuts, we need to remind the board that they need not give in to this austerity/”belt-tightening” (belt-tightening for working people, that is) logic. They can be on the right side of history. No cuts. Invest in our communities.

About this event
On May 1, International Workers Day, joins us in a car caravan picket at Port Newark, where almost all arms for Israel’s genocidal war or shipped through. Let’s show solidarity with the truckers and port workers who can join students, immigrants and all workers in shutting off the supply of bombs and shells that are killing workers in Gaza. Let’s fight back, not only by protesting what we are against, but also by unifying and mass mobilizing FOR our own program. Instead of falling for the billionaires divide-and-plunder scam, let’s join together to say: Take Back What They Have Plundered to Build A Better World for All with free education, free healthcare, clean energy, building the housing, schools hospitals that we need, creating tens of millions of good jobs.
Assemble for the Caravan at 12:30 PM at the May Day Rally, Military Park, Newark, NJ. Caravan at Port Newark 1:00 to 2:30 PM. To learn more visit http://luxemburgism.org/node/81

About this event
May Day 2025 we will come together to take a stand!

Our call is for a country that puts the people at the fore—public schools over private profits, healthcare over hedge funds, housing over homelessness, our Constitution over lawlessness. We're gathering for a world where everyone has housing, healthcare, fair wages, union protection, safety and justice—regardless of race, wealth, zip code, or immigration status.

Musk, Trump and their fellow profiteers are trying to create a race to the bottom—on wages, on benefits, on dignity itself. They’re defunding our schools, privatizing public services, attacking unions, and targeting immigrant families with fear and violence. This is a war on working people—and we will not step back. Using the principles of nonviolence and peaceful protest, we will come together and stand strong.

We will meet up and gather on the sidewalks around Rahway's Train Station Plaza, welcoming commuters as they return home from their day.

Mayday! Mayday!
The Earth's Ablaze!

In celebration of the coming of the too-warm season, a march will be taking place on May 1st, 2025, at 2:15 pm.

Do you remember when bugs and pollen would coat your parents’ windshield after a ride to the park? Or the hum of crickets and songbirds as you fell asleep after a sunny day? When forest fires were devastating instead of expected? There's a reason you don't see that today!

Since his 2nd inauguration, Trump has offered up 60% of U.S. forestland for logging, fired 1,000 park rangers, and pulled the country out of the Paris Climate Agreement. While these oligarchs won't be here in 10 years as the ecosystem reaches total collapse, many of us will be.

So fight for your planet and home! You only get one!

Meet at the intersection of 128th Ave SE & SE 164th St., where will sing as we march up towards Fairwood, WA. (Colors of the Wind, This Land Is Your Land, American Idiot, Take Me Home Country Roads, War Isn’t Murder, We Shall Overcome, Do You Hear the People Sing, Bella Ciao.)

While this event is mostly aimed at students of Charles A. Lindbergh High school, any and all are welcome to join. Remember to stick to sidewalks, and do not engage with agitators or block the street.

(Attention-grabbing costumes & signs appreciated)","The image announces a protest march taking place in Renton, WA, aimed at drawing attention to environmental issues and climate change.

Elon Musk is destroying our democracy, and he's using the fortune he built at Tesla to do it. We are taking nonviolent action at Tesla to stop Musk's illegal coup.

⚡ Sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines.
⚡ We're tanking Tesla's stock price to stop Musk.
⚡ Stopping Musk will help save lives and protect our democracy.

The stakes couldn’t be higher. No one is coming to save us.
Not politicians, not the media, not the courts.

Tesla Takedown is a peaceful protest movement. We oppose violence, vandalism and destruction of property.

About this event
Camden County Empower NJ Town Hall: Confronting the Climate and Affordability Crises

With unprecedented federal attacks on climate science, the gutting of federal protections for clean air and water, and the attempt to eliminate funding for emergency response to climate disasters, we need our elected officials in New Jersey to fill the leadership void. These attacks are happening as working families across our state are already struggling to keep up with the rising costs of healthcare, insurance, housing, and utilities, and as the damages from extreme storms, flooding, heatwaves, and wildfires continue increasing.

Join us in Camden for a town hall on these challenges and potential solutions — like the NJ Climate Superfund Act, which would ensure that the world’s wealthiest fossil fuel corporations, not taxpayers, foot the bill for climate disasters.

We’ll be joined by municipal leaders who have taken local action in support of this bill. We’ll also hear from community members who have been impacted by the climate crisis, local climate and environmental leaders, and more.

Join us to learn about these issues and how you can take action to support critical policy solutions that invest in our health, environment, and economy here in New Jersey!","The image contains details about an event titled ""Hands Off Our Planet!"" as part of the Earth Day Town Hall Series.
