They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "In 2025, Virginia is a political battleground—and the stakes couldn't be higher. MAGA and Project 2025 are working to roll back voting rights, suppress opposition, and dismantle fundamental protections like due process. But their efforts won’t stop at Virginia’s borders.\n\nWhat happens in one swing state can ripple across the country. \n\nSacramento voters should pay attention—because when MAGA and Project 2025 tactics take hold in one place, they often spread, shaping national laws, court decisions, and public opinion everywhere.\nJoin us for a critical conversation with Delegate Michael Feggans, a 20-year Air Force veteran and state legislator, about how he’s standing up for democracy in Virginia—and why his fight is our fight, too. \n\nDelegate Feggans will discuss his legislative priorities, including:\n**Reproductive Rights:** Advocating for the protection of reproductive freedoms.\n**Public Education:** Supporting increased funding and resources for public schools.\n**Veteran Affairs:** Assisting veterans in transitioning to high-tech career fields.\n**Gun Safety:** Promoting common-sense gun safety measures.\n\nWith a background in both military service and technology entrepreneurship, Delegate Feggans brings a unique perspective to the General Assembly. He is committed to serving the community that raised him and addressing the complex challenges ahead with compassionate leadership.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you on Monday May 12!",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

    "description": "Wow! What a great location for a standout! A few of us tried it out on Friday, May 2. There's a full-size sidewalk on the west side, and a narrow sidewalk (kind of like the narrow sidewalk at Mountain Park Rd.) on the east side. The west side will accommodate more people than the east side.\n\nThere's lots and lots of traffic passing by. Southampton Road (Routes 10/202) is heavily traveled northbound and southbound, and the Mass Pike eastbound and westbound is below. Lots of honks and thumbs up and waves...and a few folks flying middle fingers. We smile and wave at them all! \n\nWe'll have letterboards prepared for the lower part of the overpass fencing - the photo shows how that will look to folks passing on the Mass Pike. We're interacting with motorists on the Mass Pike, and on Southampton Road. We've discovered that the magic happens when we smile and wave to people!\n\nCome when you can, and leave when you must. You needn't be present for the entire 2-hour standout.\n\n### How to Get There\n\nThe address \"130 Southampton Road, Westfield\" will get you just north of the overpass. \n\n### Parking\n\nWe can't park in the Southampton Rd breakdown lane. There's a vacant business property three or four properties north of the bridge, and it seems that parking would be OK there.\n\nIt looks like The Wealth Technology Group has vacated their office at 130 Southampton Rd, but the internet says that other businesses are located there, so please be mindful if you decide to park there.\n\n### Etiquette!\n\nWe don't give the finger to people who give the finger to us, or who say unpleasant things. We smile and wave to them, too. \n\nWe may see a counter protester. If so, the best thing to do is just ignore them and spend our time and energy waving to motorists. Let's keep things 100% non-confrontational in words and body language.\n\n### Other Stuff\n\nPlease take everything you brought away with you, and leave the site totally clean.\n\nIf rain is predicted, we'll cancel. If we cancel, you'll receive an email notification.\n\n### A Few Requests\n\nWe've found that roof rake sections make wonderful flagpoles and banner poles. If you have a roof rake (or 10’-15’ light metal poles or conduit) to contribute, we'll be happy to take it off your hands!\n\nDonations...we've purchased banners and grommets and flags and zip ties and bungee cords, and we'll be getting more. We’ve purchased 20” x 30” letter boards for messaging we can change. All this costs $$$. We'll have a bucket for donations, and if you could throw something in, that'd be great. And if not, that's perfectly OK, too - your presence is what's really important. See where the money's going! https://tinyurl.com/IN-SLWMProtestTeamFinancials\n\n\nphoto: Rob Robertson",

We expect all hosts and participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.\n\n(If you want to try to go in, be prepared for it to be not-easy.

Mobilize requires you to put in a location.\n\nThis is a letter or postcard writing campaign that you can do on your own time.\n\nHere is what  the Fix Our Forests Act would do:\n\nThe Fix Our Forests Act presents a contentious approach to forest management, balancing wildfire mitigation efforts with environmental and public participation concerns. \n\nHR 471 passed the House.  The Senate has yet to vote.\n\nThis legislation does little to invest in research-based wildlife protections.   \n\nInstead, it focuses on opening federal lands to logging interests.  It also bypasses critical environmental laws, including the Endangered Species Act, that protect our ecosystems. It also restricts scientific input and public engagement.  The bill could have devastating consequences for the environment and endangered species.\n\nHere is a simple letter you can copy and paste to email or write to your SENATORS:\n\nDear Senator,\n\nI am writing to urge Senator _______ to oppose HR 471, the Fix Our Forests Act, which recently passed the House.  I oppose this bill because:\n\n- It ignores proven wildfire community protection measures and prioritizes opening federal lands to logging interests.\n-It will open millions of acres of federal land to logging without scientific review or community input.\n- It encourages the removal of large old trees that mitigate climate change by storing high amounts of carbon.\n-It could lead to increased road density and increased risk of human-caused fires.\n- It guts key pieces of the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nYour Constituent,\n\nYour name.",

    "description": "Zoom Informational meetings about June 16-28 march from Philly to DC\n\nDemocracy 12 aims to inspire concerned citizens of all stripes to rise up in peaceful, happy, and creative protest.\n\nWe are doing this by taking a walk–a rather long walk–from Philadelphia to DC.\n\nThat’s the big picture.\n\nHere are our two big goals:\n\nONE:\n\nWe hope to find a core group of 12 walkers. \n\nThis mission needs a human-powered spirit team, and this group has to be everything we want our democracy to be: peaceful, civil, inspired and inspiring.  Committed and reliable.  Ready to set aside ordinary things. \n\nIf you’re possibly interested in becoming part of the core team, reach out, check us out. We get that becoming a core walker is a dive-in decision, so it's probably best if you get a feel for who we are and what we are doing to make the core group a team that’s happily, totally into it. Accommodations and meals will be on a sliding-scale for this group, as we desire to have a diverse group joining us.  If you cannot make the whole walk due to other obligations please don't let that stop you from inquiring.\n\n​\n\nTWO:\n\nWe hope that our walk will inspire and support local creativity, community, and peaceful resistance, all along the way.  \n\nThis is how our march becomes your march, and actually, it’s sort of  like everyone’s march.   \n\nSo many concerned citizens are already creating and connecting in peaceful, resolute resistance, and it's already making a difference...\n\nLet's keep on keeping on.\n\nCheck out our website www.democracy12.com. We hope to see you soon!",

There is a drop off section where people hold their signs. There should be a ramp there. If you want to get as close as possible, there is an option to turn left on the side of Roundhouse/State Capitol and you can pull up to the curb at the crosswalk where a ramp is located.\n\nThere is also an accessible entrance to the Roundhouse/State Capitol through \"Capitol North\" on Don Gaspar Avenue (the one-way street). Follow the blue accessibility signs to the ramp and to the accessible entrance. This option will not accommodate someone with limited mobility who needs direct access and requires a shorter distance.\n\nPhysical Address: 490 Old Santa Fe Trail, Santa Fe, NM 87501\nFree parking is available Monday through Friday at 420 Galisteo St.\n\nHelpful links:\nhttps://santafe.com/getting-here/ \nhttps://www.nmlegis.gov/Visitors",

    "description": "Join tens of thousands of your fellow Chicago-area citizens as we form a human chain of conscience across Chicagoland in peaceful protest against Trump’s illegal and authoritarian actions and the GOP's failure to defend the Constitution.\n\nWe will line sidewalks along 30 miles from Aurora to Chicago along Ogden Ave, 26th Street and California Ave to Douglass Park. This is a peaceful protest. We will not block streets or businesses along the route.\n\nBring signs, wear black, and make some noise.\n\nFind and reserve your spot here: www.handsacrosschi.com\n\nUsing the website widget will help us spread people out evenly along the route, while keeping people close to where they live.\n\nPresident Trump has defied court orders and forcibly sent people to a torture dungeon in El Salvador without a hearing or due process. Now he claims he’s unable to bring them back. He's ignored court rulings and arrested judges. If he can do this to them, he can do it to anyone.\n\nThese are the actions of a dictator—not a democratically elected president. Silence is not an option. When leaders cross the line into authoritarianism, it’s up to us—the people—to push back. This protest is about more than politics. It's about defending basic human dignity, civil liberties, and the idea that no one is above the law.",

    "description": "Zoom Informational meetings about June 16-28 march from Philly to DC\n\nDemocracy 12 aims to inspire concerned citizens of all stripes to rise up in peaceful, happy, and creative protest.\n\nWe are doing this by taking a walk–a rather long walk–from Philadelphia to DC.\n\nThat’s the big picture.\n\nHere are our two big goals:\n\nONE:\nWe hope to find a core group of 12 walkers. \n\nThis mission needs a human-powered spirit team, and this group has to be everything we want our democracy to be: peaceful, civil, inspired and inspiring.  Committed and reliable.  Ready to set aside ordinary things. \n\nIf you’re possibly interested in becoming part of the core team, reach out, check us out. We get that becoming a core walker is a dive-in decision, so it's probably best if you get a feel for who we are and what we are doing to make the core group a team that’s happily, totally into it. Accommodations and meals will be on a sliding-scale for this group, as we desire to have a diverse group joining us.  If you cannot make the whole walk due to other obligations please don't let that stop you from inquiring.\n\nWe will post and email route/hotel information as soon as it is available on our website for both \"core walkers\" and anyone that wants to participate. \n​\n\nTWO:\nWe hope that our walk will inspire and support local creativity, community, and peaceful resistance, all along the way.  \n\nThis is how our march becomes your march, and actually, it’s sort of  like everyone’s march.   \n\nSo many concerned citizens are already creating and connecting in peaceful, resolute resistance, and it's already making a difference...\n\nLet's keep on keeping on.\n\nCheck out our website www.democracy12.com. We hope to see you soon!",

They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

    "description": "Join Capital Region Indivisible groups and other area activists to protest Elise Stefanik and the GOP at their Spring Picnic in Elm Avenue Park, Bethlehem. \n\nARRIVAL TIME: Plan to be parked and in place by 1:30 when GOP will start arriving. Their event starts at 2:00 and people will arrive before that. Also press often come early and then leave, so we want good numbers early.\n\nPARKING: As you enter the park, the best place to park are the lots on your right behind the tennis courts. If those fill up head to the left and park in the large lots next to the pool complex. Do NOT park by the playground further down. \n\nWHERE WE WILL BE LOCATED: We will be protesting along the road on Rt. 32 and immediately inside the park along the road leading to the parking lots. We are not protesting at the event pavilion as we want to keep this peaceful, AND optics for newspaper pictures will be a lot better with us all at the front of the park.\n\nMESSAGING AND SIGNS: Let's be sure everyone knows the harms the GOP and Stefanik are inflicting on everyday people by their votes to cut benefits and programs (Medicaid, food stamps, rental assistance, benefits for children with disabilities, etc) all so they can give tax breaks for their wealthy donors, corporations and billionaire friends, that Stefanik votes in lock step with the Republican led Congress, and that she is not welcome here!\n\nHANDS OFF ________________ GOP!\nHANDS OFF OUR HEALTHCARE ELISE!\nGO HOME ELISE!\nELISE & GOP VOTE FOR TAX CUTS FOR BILLIONAIRES!\nNO CUTS TO OUR BENEFITS FOR BILLIONAIRE GIVE AWAYS!\nSHAME ON THE GOP!\nELISE, YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE!\n\nSAFETY AND RESTROOMS: We will have trained Safety marshalls circulating and helping to direct you to parking and restrooms. Restrooms are in the warming hut if you are familiar with the park.\n\nEveryone must be committed to non-violence and non-engagement even if provoked. We want a peaceful and powerful demonstration.",

Let's show the unelected billionaire Elon Musk and his co-president that we won't let them run roughshod over our Constitution or our federal government. Join us in front of the Tesla dealership on Route 22 in Springfield. This location also happens to be in Tom Kean Jr's congressional district (NJ-7) so let's make sure we keep demanding he stops hiding and hosts a public town hall.\n\nParking is generally available at the Staples across the street, which also has supplies for signs. Then we make our way open to the grassy area in front of the Tesla dealership. Remember, this is an entirely peaceful protest!",

If you're wondering if voters are having buyers' remorse, now is the time to find out!\n\nIn this presentation/training, we will be covering what direct voter contact is, why it's important, why it works, why we need to do it not only during election years but year-round, and, more importantly, what we can do as a county party in order for you to feel safe and comfortable in talking to voters!\n\nAfter the presentation, we will partner you up with an experienced canvasser to test out your newly-learned skills! Do not worry, we will assure you that you will not go out alone for your first time!",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

This is a peaceful protest. We will not block streets or businesses along the route.\n\nRegister on Mobilize, then please go to https://www.handsacrosschi.com/ and enter your zip code to get an assigned location along the route. This is important so that we can spread people out evenly along the route, while keeping people closer to where they live. IGNORE THE MAP BELOW; THIS IS NOT YOUR ASSIGNED LOCATION.\n\nPresident Trump has defied court orders and forcibly sent people to a torture dungeon in El Salvador without a hearing or due process. Now he claims he’s unable to bring them back. He's ignored court rulings and arrested judges. If he can do this to them, he can do it to anyone.\n\nThese are the actions of a dictator—not a democratically elected president. Silence is not an option. When leaders cross the line into authoritarianism, it’s up to us—the people—to push back. This protest is about more than politics. It's about defending basic human dignity, civil liberties, and the idea that no one is above the law.\n\nBring your family, friends, neighbors, coworkers—anyone who believes in freedom and democracy.",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\nSaturday, June 14th is Flag Day and a good time to remind Trump and the MAGA crowd this is OUR flag and we are taking it back from this authoritarian administration. \n\nJune 14 also happens to be the birthday of the narcissistic wannabe King. Trump plans to hold a military parade in DC, so we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings!\n\nWe’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\nJoin us at Springfield at City Hall from 12:00-2:00PM.  \nTogether we will rally to declare NO Kings AND to take back our flag!\nThis event is co-hosted by Rise Up Western Mass Indivisible, Indivisible Northampton/Swing Left Western Mass, and Defending Democracy in Hampden County.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

The world is watching and we want to build on the energy of our rally on April 5.   Join us to SPEAK OUT NOW! and show that the administration does not have a mandate for their harmful actions. \n\nWe are gathering for a peaceful protest the first and third Saturdays of each month in Pittsboro. ***We will now gather at the sidewalk in front of the Chatham PTA Thrift/True Value Hardware and walk up to and around the old courthouse.** Bring signs. Bring friends, family, and neighbors. Meet like-minded people, network with others who are concerned for our democracy and SPEAK OUT NOW! \n\nThere are lots of public parking spaces around town.  Please park where you like, and meet us to march up to the Old Courthouse.  We don't want to clog up any of the business parking lots, but if you do park in a business lot, please try to patronize that business :-)\n\nOur first two events in April and May were positive and show the need for this community event!  Join us and let's grow the opposition!",

    "description": "This Mother’s Day, we gather not just with flowers—but with fire in our hearts and justice in our voices. On Saturday, May 10, we rally in honor of all mothers:\n🌸 The ones who raised us in freedom,\n🌸 The ones who are raising the next generation,\n🌸 The ones who dream of becoming moms someday—and deserve the right to choose when and if they do,\n🌸 And the mothers enduring the fallout of failed policies: economic hardship, crumbling healthcare systems, attacks on reproductive freedom, and schools stripped of resources.\n\nThis is also for the mothers of immigrants, of children wrongfully detained, and of communities silenced by cruelty and neglect. It’s for every woman fighting to give her children a better future—and for the daughters who are demanding one.\n\n🚨On Saturday, May 10 from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, we’ll be at Good Trouble Corner (McBean & Valencia Blvd, Santa Clarita) to stand together in solidarity.🚨\n\nWe’re not waiting for change. We are the change. We’re building a movement where every voice counts and every family matters.\n\nA core principle behind this event is a commitment to nonviolence and community care. We expect all participants to uplift each other and de-escalate when needed—we lead with peace, love, and strength. We recommend all participants review our safety and security resource before your event: https://indivisi.org/safety\n\n💌 More Info: www.indivisibleCA27.com\n📧 Contact Us: CA27indivisible@gmail.com\n\nBring your signs. Bring your stories. Bring your love for the women who made you. ✊💐\nLet’s show up for all our mothers—past, present, and future.",

This is her home, and she wants it to be the best possible place to raise a family, live, and retire.\n\nLily’s SWVA roots go deep, she knows that Virginia doesn’t end in Charlottesville and has shared in the pain of neglect with her neighbors. Lily and her brother both graduated from Northside High School. She completed a bachelor’s degree in political science at Longwood University while her brother started a small business in Christiansburg.\n\nLily can put a proven record, established contacts, and in-depth knowledge of the inner workings of our Commonwealth’s government to work for SWVA. She knows the problems we face in SWVA because she lives here. She can bring concrete solutions to these problems from Richmond because she’s worked there.\n\nWe'll be back at the always kid and dog friendly space, Old Stove Ship Canal, rain or shine! \n\n600 W Nickerson St, Seattle, WA 98119\nhttp://www.oldstove.com/shipcanal\n\n2-4PM, 5/18/25\n\nWe hope to see you there! \n\nCheers,\nSister District Puget Sound",

We'll place our tombstones in the ground and lie down — to mark what has already fallen.\n\nLet’s make this visual, mournful, and unforgettable.\n\nDeath is near — and we feel it.

    "description": "Join Indivisible Lambertville New Hope (ILNH) at our first Field Team 6 event!  While some ILNH Indivizzies will be marching in the Saturday, May 17th Lambertville-New Hope Pride Parade, we’ll be among the crowd registering voters! After a brief check in (Lambertville meetup location given after completion of registration), we'll mingle among the parade onlookers and register voters!  We'll be out until noon and then meet back at our morning gathering location to debrief and congratulate ourselves on a job well done!  We ask that you wear hats, shirts and/or buttons that make clear that you’re a liberal. We'll provide you with everything you need to invite democrats to register to vote. \n\nAbout FT6:\nField Team 6 (FT6) is a volunteer army on a simple mission: Register Democrats. Save the World. FT6 is working to restore the Democratic trifecta, to empower Congress to pass game-changing voting rights, abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights, civil rights, and so much more. ILNH will be using FT6’s approach in advance of the NJ governor's race. Field Team 6’s efforts are laser-focused on registering women, people of color, young people, LGBTQ+ and disabilities communities, veterans and faith communities and every good-hearted human we can find.",

Our purpose in gathering is to bring attention to the destruction of our democratic principles by the ongoing actions of the Trump-Musk administration.\n\nWe practice peaceful nonviolence and nonconfrontation. Although we are all very concerned about Elon Musk's activities and unconstitutional meddling in our democracy, we protest peacefully. Do not respond to those who may express a different point of view. And please do not target people passing by in Tesla vehicles. Our focus is on supporting democracy and opposing the destruction of our institutions, the agencies that we depend on, our rights, and our freedoms.\n\nLet's keep the rally momentum going! Stand up for democracy! Build community! Bring your signs and your voices! Bring friends!\n\nNOTE: Please DO NOT park in the Tesla lot!! There are many other parking options in the area.",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re taking to the streets nationwide. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

We’ve watched as they’ve cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political views, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They’ve done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies.\n\n\n🚨**On Saturday, June 14, we’re holding a rally in St. Augustine. We’re not gathering to feed his ego. We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\n\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

HB 220 has passed out of the House, but we need Chairmen Hughes to schedule it for a Senate State Affairs hearing ASAP! \n\nThis bill would require Texas health care facilities to provide access to emergency contraception if clinically indicated and consent given, a private space when available, and the option to shower after a forensic exam. These are basic, trauma-informed protections that support survivors in their healing process.\n\nCollege students and young people face a higher risk of sexual violence, yet many do not receive adequate care when they seek help. HB 220 takes a step toward ensuring all survivors in Texas are treated with the care and respect they deserve.\n\nChairmen Hughes needs to hear from you! Urge him to bring HB 220/SB 1899 for a hearing and demand better care for survivors.\n\n\nNote: Once you hit \"Send an Email\" you should get an email pop-up allowing you to customize your message before sending it to the Chairmen Hughes.

All are invited who feel the Trump Administration has created a constitutional crisis and the systematic dismantling of our governmental institutions, universities and way of life.  \n\n*It takes courage to come out in public and protest/exercise your I st Amendment Right.\n*If you choose to do so, you will not be alone. You will be with like minded people from your home community. No longer will your feelings be pent up inside and you will feel a sense of freedom.\n*By protesting you will let your community know that we are not ok with what's going on in Washington.\n*We need to be mindful that this is a State highway. Be careful. We need to be mindful that people park their cars and walk the sidewalks in the Maytown Square. Do not make an issue for these folks.\n*Bring your signs. Think about topics that unite all people-Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans, Department of Education, tariffs and the list goes on forever. We will have prizes for the following categories-funny, creative and artistic. Prizes awarded at end of event.\n*No obscenities. Be prepared to be confronted. Be prepared to have a finger directed your way. Smile and tell them to have a nice day. Defuse. If necessary, walk away.\n*Invite your friends, family members and anyone who you believe would have an interest in protesting. We don't have to drive to Lancaster, Harrisburg or Washington DC.",

    "description": "VENMO @SaveFWCC to contribute to our campaign\n\nFOLLOW on Instagram @SaveFWCC\n\nFor over a century, Fort Washington Collegiate Church has served the uptown community as more than just a house of worship. Ft. Washington is a beacon of light, a collective gathering point, and an anchor for numerous programs serving our Washington Heights and uptown community. The closure on June 30, 2025, will force Ft. Washington and the programs that call this place home to shutter their doors, leaving a massive void in our communal social fabric. \n\nFt. Washington is a symbol of unity and togetherness. It is a center for local music and the arts through the Fort Washington Community Choir, Washington Heights Chamber Orchestra, Up Theater, and Uptown Enclave. It embodies interfaith connection through the Fort Tryon Jewish Center, offers a sanctuary of nature and beauty through the Fort Washington Green, a center for recovery through AA, Al-Anon, and NA meetings, and nourishes families through the Fort Fridge.\n\nThe greater Collegiate Board’s recent decision to close Ft. Washington will rob our community of these essential programs, resources, and vital communal space. As friends and neighbors who benefit from and greatly appreciate Ft. Washington's contributions to our community, we seek your help. We implore the Collegiate Board to stop the proposed shutdown on June 30, 2025 and allow Ft. Washington and its community partners time to secure additional funding.\n\nThe closure of Ft. Washington’s campus represents the death of a piece of the heart of our uptown community. The fight to keep this beloved space open is a fight to keep our community whole. Please join this community led effort to urge the Consistory to stop the proposed closure of Ft. Washington Collegiate Church on June 30, 2025. \n\nSome of the groups who meet in this sacred space include:\nSupport and Recovery Groups\nFort Fridge\nFort Tryon Jewish Center\nFort Washington Collegiate Church\nFort Washington Community Choir\nFort Washington Green\nUptown Enclave\nUp Theater Company\nWashington Heights Chamber Orchestra\n\n_________________________\n\n\nDurante más de un siglo, la Iglesia Colegiada de Fort Washington ha servido a la comunidad del norte de Manhattan como algo más que un lugar de adoración. Fort Washington es un faro de luz, un punto de encuentro colectivo y un pilar para numerosos programas que sirven a nuestra comunidad de Washington Heights.Cerrando las puertas de Fort Washington el 30 de junio de 2025 dejará un enorme vacío en el tejido social de nuestra comunidad.\n\nFort Washington es un símbolo de unidad y solidaridad. Es un centro para la música local y las artes a través del Coro Comunitario de Fort Washington, la Orquesta de Cámara de Washington Heights, Up Theater y Uptown Enclave. Representa la conexión interreligiosa mediante el Centro Judío Fort Tryon, ofrece un santuario de naturaleza y belleza a través del Fort Washington Green, un centro de recuperación con los grupos de apoyo AA, Al-Anon, y NA, y nutre a las familias a través del Fort Fridge.\n\nLa reciente decisión del Consistorio de cerrar Fort Washington privará a nuestra comunidad de estos programas esenciales, recursos y espacio comunitario. Como amigos y vecinos que benefician y aprecian profundamente las contribuciones de Fort Washington a nuestra comunidad, solicitamos su ayuda. Imploramos al Consistorio que detenga el cierre propuesto para el 30 de junio de 2025 y permita que Fort Washington y sus socios comunitarios tengan tiempo para asegurar fondos adicionales.\n\nEl cierre del campus de Fort Washington representa la pérdida de una parte del corazón de nuestra comunidad del norte de Manhattan. La lucha por mantener este querido espacio abierto es una lucha por preservar la integridad de nuestra comunidad. Únase a este esfuerzo liderado por la comunidad para detener el cierre propuesto de la Iglesia Colegial Fort Washington el 30 de junio de 2025.\n\nRegístrese pare recibir actualizaciones o ser voluntario \n\nPara aprender más sobre Fort Washington y sus socios comunitarios:\n\nGrupos de Apoyo Mutuo\nFort Fridge\nFort Tryon Jewish Center\nFort Washington Collegiate Church\nFort Washington Community Choir\nFort Washington Green\nUptown Enclave\nUp Theater Company\nWashington Heights Chamber Orchestra\n\nReport a policy violation",

    "description": "Join UNITED WEST VIRGINIA as we support the national call for protest by the National Single Payer (NSP) organization AND we stand up for Veterans, to the Trump Administration!\n\nFrom the NSP: Our health care system is broken beyond repair. Insurance companies and for-profit middlemen create barriers to care and massive administrative waste. These result in unnecessary suffering and deaths. For over 60 years, piecemeal reforms have resulted in higher costs and the worst health outcomes among comparable nations. Please see their list of demands at: https://nationalsinglepayer.com/national-day-of-action/\n\nThe Trump Administration will cut nearly 80,000 employees from the VA in two phases; June 1st and September 1st. Our Veterans sacrificed EVERYTHING to defend our Democracy. We will stand up for their rights, now!\n\nPlease bring a human or pet food donation if you can, thank you!",

I have never served or not a veteran.** \n\nJust like 47 failed Day 1 promises of lower gas prices, affordable housing and lower gas prices, he and his billionaire buddies are making way to break the promises America made to veterans. When the current administration attacks one, they attacks us all. About 1/3 of federal workers are also veterans and want to send a clear message to this current administration to defend the benefits, jobs and dignity which every generation of veterans has earned through sacrifice. **THEY ARE THE FEW! WE ARE THE MANY!**\n\n**THE PACT ACT IS UNDER ATTACK**\nThe **P** in **PACT** stands for **Promise**.  For this virtual event,  **P** stands for **Pledge**  for positive action to **resist** the status quo, **insist** on the rule of law, **persist** for democracy and **enlist** for the cause by attending or sharing this rally. **PLEDGE TO DO YOUR PART SO CONGRESS IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE AMERICAN PROMISE TO VETERANS!**\n\n**Pledge** to do anything or everything you can to support this rally. Veterans want to unite veterans and also all Americans as this fight is for all of us **against the criminality, cruelty and corruption** of 47 and his billionaire buddies.\n\n**NO KINGS! NOT EVER!**\n**We do not consent to this president.**\n**We are a PEOPLE POWERED MOVEMENT!**\n\n**We all have the power to be courageous. Let’s spread the word of courage, to reclaim our power!**",

We’re building a movement that leaves him behind.**🚨\n\n\nThe flag doesn’t belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to us. We’re not watching history happen. We’re making it.\n\n\n**On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t—to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.**\nCheck out nokings.org for more information.\n\n*A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*",

Anyone who picks up is usually glad to hear from the Party. If nobody answers, leave a message. (Then, if you're comfortable, follow up with a text.)\n\n## WRITE THIS DOWN BEFORE YOU CALL.\nYou will urge Charlotte Dems to call the Supervisor of Elections (SOE) (941-833-5400) or update their VBM enrollment at the SOE website: https://www.soecharlottecountyfl.gov/Voter-Information/Vote-By-Mail.",
