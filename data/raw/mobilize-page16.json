    "description": "Indivisible Windward Swing Left is hosting these recurring rallies!!! Weekly sign waving protests for Kilmar's return. As you know, Donald Trump falsely declared a state of emergency to employ the 1798 Alien and Sedition Act, which has only been used in times of war, to illegally expel non-citizens of their arbitrary choice. In the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, ICE ignored a court order protecting him from deportation because of danger to him should he be sent to El Salvador. Without due process of law, Kilmar was sent anyway, leaving behind his child and pregnant wife in Maryland. The Trump administration is now ignoring a Supreme Court order for Kilmar's return to the US to receive a legal hearing!!! If this stands, Trump says he will begin deporting US citizens without due process of law...and there goes the Constitution. Protests against DOGE and other are welcome.\n\nWhen: Every Wednesday at 4:30-5:30pm \nWhere: Intersection of Ku'ulei Rd and Oneawa St under the big tree \n\nContact: Lois at LBC@hawaiiantel.net\nbring a sign!",

Go to [linktr.ee/stepupcd8](https://linktr.ee/stepupcd8).)  \n\n\nWe’re standing up to **Donald Trump** because **Rep. Abe Hamadeh won’t**!  \n\n\nJoin your neighbors for a peaceful, high-visibility protest as part of the **Step Up CD-8 multi-site protest**.  \n\n\nWhile Trump and his billionaire friends dismantle our government for their own personal gain, CD-8 Congressman **Abe Hamadeh has been hiding from constituents** behind closed-door events with donors and MAGA voters.  \n\n\nFor months, concerned constituents across CD-8 have asked Rep. Abe Hamadeh to hold a public town hall and listen to the concerns of the people he was elected to represent. Instead, we’ve been met with silence — and even **threats of arrest**.  \n\n\nWhen we demonstrated peacefully outside his office, his staff **had a senior adult woman’s car towed**. When our numbers grew, Hamadeh coordinated with GOP counter-protestors to **obstruct our access to a public sidewalk**.  \n\n\n**It’s clear: Hamadeh answers to Trump, not to us.**  \n\n\nSo on **May 10**, we’re taking the message to five cities across CD-8:  \n**Enough.**  \n\n---\n\n### We'll be at the following locations:\n\n- Lake Pleasant Pkwy & Happy Valley Rd in **Peoria**\n- Anthem Way & Gavilan Peak Pkwy in **Anthem**\n- Civic Center Dr. & Bell Rd in **Surprise**\n- 99th Ave & Bell Rd in **Sun City**\n- 35th Ave & Peoria in **Phoenix**\n\n---\n\n### Here’s what we need you to do:\n\n- Bring signs (see sign ideas below)  \n\n- Wear sun protection  \n\n- Stay hydrated  \n\n- Be respectful and nonviolent  \n\n\n---\n\nThis coordinated effort is powered by a coalition of grassroots groups:  \n**Northwest Valley Indivisible, Anthem Indivisible, Desert Progressives, The Pushback Club,** and **The Big Blue Bubble.**  \n\n\nTogether, we’re standing up for democracy and demanding real accountability in Arizona’s 8th Congressional District.  \n\n\n---\n\n### Sign Ideas:\n\n- Stop the Billionaire Give-Away  \n\n- Hands Off Social Security *(or ...Vaccines, ...Medicare, …Medicaid, …Education, ...the VA, …AHCCCS, etc.)*  \n\n- Stop the Cuts *(...in Education, …in the VA, …in AHCCCS, etc.)*\n\n- Abe Hamadeh Serves His Base, Not His District  \n\n- Abe Hamadeh Works for Mar-a-Lago, Not Arizona  \n\n- Abe Hamadeh Supports Cuts to Cancer Research *(or ...VA Services, ...Special Education, etc.)*  \n\n- Abe Hamadeh Supports the J6 Attack On Democracy  \n\n- Abe Hamadeh: Silent on Trump’s Threats to Birthright Citizenship  \n\n- Abe Hamadeh: Silent on Corruption, Loud on Conspiracy  \n\n- Abe Hamadeh: Loyal to Trump, Not the Constitution  \n\n- Abe Hamadeh: Subsidizing Billionaires With VA Job Cuts  \n\n- Abe Hamadeh: Loyal to Trump, Lying to You  \n\n- Abe Hamadeh Supports Trump’s Union Busting  \n\n- Abe Hamadeh Threatens Veterans & Retirees With Arrest  \n\n- Abe Hamadeh Refuses a Public Town Hall",

Turn that energy into action! Join us for a \"Future Constituent\" Postcard Party where you can document your DC concerns and suggestions that will be delivered directly to congressional offices.\n\n## What We're Doing 🗣️\nWe're creating postcards addressed to members of Congress from their \"future constituents\" (that's us!) to help them understand what they'd be responsible for if they repeal Home Rule:\n* Fixing your neighborhood potholes\n* Handling trash collection complaints\n* Managing local park maintenance\n* Resolving parking disputes\n* Addressing school funding issues\n\n## Why It Works 💡\nDuring our recent congressional visits, these postcards sparked meaningful conversations with staffers who suddenly realized the burden of managing local DC issues. As one participant noted: \"It creates a starting point for dialogue about what repealing Home Rule would actually mean for them.\"\n\n## Join Us! 📅\n* **When**: Wednesday, May 21st, 6:00-8:00 PM\n* **Where**: Women's National Democratic Club in Dupont Circle. We will be joining the existing Winning Wednesdays action nights at this lovely venue!\n* **Materials**: All provided - just bring your DC experiences!\n* **Impact**: Your postcards will be hand-delivered during our weekly congressional visits\n\nCan't make this event? Contact us about hosting your own postcard party with friends, neighbors, or colleagues!\n\nRemember: \"This is a marathon, not a sprint\" - and your voice matters in this fight for DC's autonomy!",

This reorganization starts at the County Convention, where we elect our precinct leadership, the county’s Executive Committee, and delegates to the State Convention in Owensboro on June 14, 2025.\n\n## Who can participate?\n\nAny registered Democratic voter in Franklin County can participate.  You can check your voter registration status here: (https://vrsws.sos.ky.gov/vic/Default.aspx) Only voters registered as democrats in Franklin County will be admitted to the event.\n\n## Why should I come?\n\nWhether you are concerned about the Trump agenda nationally or the growing strength of the Republican Party in Franklin County, this is your chance to make your voice heard! Run for a leadership position or just come have your say about what the party should be doing in these difficult times.  Be there!",

When asked when it would be ready, they said they didn't know\n  - They have met with immigrants rights groups such as Make the Road NJ to get community input which is good\n  - From April's meeting, not 1 commissioner could commit to eliminating an ICE detention company as an option for the sale\n  - There are 9 commissioners that will get to vote on how to decide what to do with the jail\n\nHoping you can make the May commissioners meeting to continue asking questions, ensuring accountability and sharing stories of how ICE harms communities.

    "description": "This is a SILENT protest to bring visibility to and honor our Veterans hosted by Indivisible Acworth. We invite our community to stand in solidarity with our veterans.\n\nWe are hosting a silent protest on Sunday, May 25th at the Cobb VA North Clinic in Marietta to raise awareness regarding the assault to veterans' benefits, entitlements, and access to care. \n\nOn Thursday, the US Department of Veterans Affairs ended a mortgage rescue program that has helped almost 20,000 veterans avoid foreclosure and keep their homes. Approximately 90,000 VA loans are at risk of foreclosure and this number continues to increase as more and more veterans are illegally terminated from their Federal jobs by DOGE. \n\nIf the administration can cut this program, reduce vital staff, and create restrictions to the Suicide Hotline, what else do they plan to cut? \n\nWe must gather in solidarity behind the veteran community and we must stand up and fight in memory of the veterans who stood up to, and lost their lives in their combat against fascism and human rights violations.\n\nBecause Memorial Day is a solemn day of remembrance, we ask that protestors do not scream and that signage remains RESPECTFUL and relates ONLY to cuts to veterans programs, supporting our veterans, supporting VA staff, and signs that honor the fallen and defend the living.\n\nSign ideas include, but are not limited to: ﻿﻿﻿﻿\n\n﻿\"Honor the Fallen. Care for the Living.\"﻿﻿\n\"They Fought for Us — Now We Fight for Them.\"\n\"Cuts to VA = Dishonor to Their Sacrifice.\"\n\"Memorial Day Is More Than Words — Fund the VA!\"\n﻿\"Project 2025: Betraying the Oath to Those Who Took One.\"\n\"Protect the VA, Protect the Promise.\"\n\"Fully Staff the VA — Lives Depend on It.\"\n\"No More Delays. No More Cuts. No More Excuses.\"\n\"Veterans Before Politics.\"\n\"We Lost Brothers/Sisters in War — Don’t Lose Them to Policy.\"\n\"No Vet Should Fight for Benefits They Earned in Combat.\"﻿﻿\n\"From Battlefield to Bureaucracy — Stop the War on Veterans.\"\n\"Veterans Deserve Dignity, Not Budget Cuts.\"\n\nAgain, please keep signs respectful. There is a time and place for more humorous or abrasive messaging, but we are showing solidarity with our vets.",

    "description": "Freedom from Fear is a basic human right, but many of us have never been so afraid of what is happening in our country. The parallels with some of the most horrific events in world history are too great. Trump is determined to defy the Constitution and send people to a foreign prison with no due process. And we must fight against it.\n\nRep. Mark Messmer is complicit. He and other Republicans are supercharging ICE’s budget from its current $9 billion to up to $175 billion. Using data acquired by Elon Musk’s DOGE and employing private companies, ICE will expand its ability to surveil, track, and arrest people. \n\nTrump is testing our democracy, the courts, and the balance of powers. If he is successful, he will send American citizens next. Right there in the Oval Office, he told the president of El Salvador to build a bigger prison, because he wants to send “homegrowns.” He will say they are criminals, even if he has no proof, just as he is doing now. \n\nMany of us are alarmed by the cracking foundations of our democracy and our most basic Constitutional rights, our so-called Representative refuses to face us, and won’t listen to us. As a long-time 8th district political analyst recently observed, “The House member is the one member of the federal government who is supposed to be closest to the people, the most reachable. And Messmer seems to be the opposite of that. He’s unreachable.”\n\nTo force accountability from Rep. Mark Messmer, and elevate his role in these illegal and inhumane deportations, We have started a petition at change.org/markmessmer because:\n\nWe don’t know whether any of the people sent to the CECOT so-called “mega-prison”—which functionally meets the definition of a concentration camp—are guilty of any crimes. None were tried in a court of law. They were simply disappeared.\n\nAny claim that they aren’t entitled to legal rights is false, anti-American, and unconstitutional. The Constitution protects persons, not just citizens. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee due process for everyone on U.S. soil.\n\nAt this precarious moment in our Republic, with an executive branch pushing the limits of our separation of powers, we need members of Congress who will stand up and defend the Constitution they swore to uphold.\n\nGo to change.org/markmessmer and tell Rep. Mark Messmer that no 8th District resident should be sent to a foreign prison. \n\nBecause if they come for one of us, they will have to come for all of us.",

This is a crisis, and the time to act is now.\n\n🚨 On Saturday, May 10th, we're taking to the streets to fight back with a clear message: Hands off! 🚨\n\n📍 Where: Police Station Common Area 📅 When: 1:30-2:30PM May 10, 2025\n\nThis mass mobilization day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies. Alongside Americans across the country, we are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop the chaos and build an opposition movement against the looting of our country.\n\nA core principle behind all Hands Off! events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.\n\nCheck out handsoff2025.com for more information.",

    "description": "We’re weeks out from the NYC primary election, and the stakes are HIGH to block Andrew Cuomo and elect a mayor who will deliver on an affordable city, prioritizing the needs of working families above the demands of the rich and well-connected.\n\nNYC doesn’t need to replace one power-hungry, scandal-ridden politician with another. We can elect a mayor we can all be proud of, but we must do it together! With multiple progressive candidates running, the NY WFP is taking on the challenge of keeping progressives united, asking voters to rank ALL candidates on the Working Families Slate—Adrienne Adams, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani and Zellnor Myrie—to make sure that a Working Families champion is the next mayor of New York City.\n\nWe won't be able to do this without YOU! Join us to make hundreds of calls to voters across NYC and remind them to flex their vote and #RankTheSlate for NYC mayor.\n\nNo experience necessary—we'll provide training at the beginning of every phone bank. RSVP and tell a friend to double your impact!",

We are open to anyone interested in knowing and/or sharing how to protect your rights at home or in your neighborhood.\n\nZoom invites will be sent to attendees who have signed up prior to the event.

    "description": "We invite you to join us for the Eastern region coalition meeting on **Tuesday, May 13th, from 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM**. This meeting will be HYBRID, so you can participate virtually via Zoom or attend in person at 308 Meadows St, New Bern, NC 28560.\n\nWe’re excited to welcome Rodolfo Martinez Barron, Director of Advocacy and Civic Engagement at AMEXCAN, as a guest speaker this month. Rodolfo will share insights on immigrant rights, the challenges immigrant communities face across North Carolina, and how we can work in solidarity and support as strong allies—especially here in Eastern NC.\n\nAfter hearing from Rodolfo, we’ll revisit key issues discussed at our last meeting and provide the latest updates on the NC Supreme Court election status and the SAVE Act.\n\nAlthough we have been facing many issues over the past few months, we will come together to see what we can do to mitigate the harm being done. Regardless, we will persevere together by sharing information and collaborating on what actions we can take. **Knowledge is liberation. Solidarity is strength.**\n\nRemember, we are in this together, so please join us for our monthly meeting, either in person or online. We will share knowledge, support one another, and strategize for the future.",

(You must attend in person)\n\nWe should be able to make our voices heard at the polls and have a say in the leaders who represent us. But sometimes, politicians push for laws that discourage, obstruct, or even intimidate voters in an effort to cling to their power.\n\nPolling place closures, limits to vote-by-mail, and needlessly strict voter ID regulations can prevent eligible voters from casting their ballot—and lately, this playbook of voter suppression strategies has become more popular. Common Cause is stopping voter suppression by opposing these efforts in the legislature, in the courts, and beyond in defense of the right to vote.",

But in 2025-26, we need to do something more and different to win.  House parties can:\n\n- Reach voters outside of our political bubbles\n\n- Have friend and neighbor conversations with those who support our democratic values\n\n- Inoculate voters against the onslaught of right-wing media\n\n- Expand our volunteer base\n\n**Are you thinking about hosting a house party, but don't know how to get started?**  If you've never hosted one before (and even if you're a fellow introvert), or just want a refresher, join the Bay Area Coalition every Monday, 5 pm (PT) / 7 pm (CT) / 8 pm (ET) for our ** *nationwide* ** house party workshop ...\n\n - How to plan your house party\n\n - Tips and tools for hosting conversations with your friends, neighbors, colleagues\n\n*You'll leave the workshop fired up and ready to host your house party!*\n\nSign up here for ** *California* ** house party workshops - https://www.mobilize.us/cadems/event/759747/\n\nFor more Bay Area Coalition actions: https://bayareacoalition.org/",

Home to dozens of wildlife species, including a family of nesting bald eagles, a weekly fun run, and a well used road for running, biking, playing, roller skating, and track practices, it’s been an oasis of open space since it was closed to vehicle traffic in 2020.  A haphazard move backed by Councilwoman Hanks, District Attorney McMahon, and Borough President Fossella to reintroduce vehicle traffic to the park is putting lives at risk. \n\nIf you agree that parks are no place for cars, join Transportation Alternatives on May 10th for a march on the offices of Councilwoman Hanks and District Attorney McMahon! \n\nWe will meet at the intersection of Silver Lake Park Road and Forest Avenue before a 1.7-mile march downhill to the offices of Councilwoman Hanks and District Attorney McMahon at 130 Stuyvesant Ave.",

    "description": "***Información en español a continuación****\nJoin us for a one night only screening of a new documentary film, And Water Brings Tomorrow.  The screening will be followed by a live Q&A with the filmmaker, Ashley Hunt.\n\nAnd Water Brings Tomorrow is a film about change that looks at closed prisons around the U.S., considering what they’ve turned into, the community efforts behind their closure, and the forms of loss and reckoning that their closure does and does not address. \n\nLight Refreshments are included. Registration for a ticket is required. \n\nTickets are free, however sliding scale donations are highly encouraged at the door to support our local Shut Down GEO campaign. Suggested donation is $10, $15 or $20. No one will be turned away due to lack of funds.  https://secure.afsc.org/a/shut-down-geo\n\nHosts:\nShut Down GEO Aurora is a coalition of individuals and organizations seeking to close Immigration and Customs Enforcement's for-profit prison run by GEO Group, Inc. in Aurora, CO. The Coalition is working with the community to vision new uses for the land and building and to fight an upcoming contract renewal. \n\nThe Denver Justice and Peace Committee (DJPC) is a grassroots organization, that promotes human rights, economic, and environmental justice through education and nonviolent activism to support communities, seeking justice for all people. We stand in solidarity with peoples in the Americas, particularly with oppressed communities in Latin America.\n\nThe American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) promotes a world free of violence, inequality, and oppression. Guided by the Quaker belief in the divine Light within each person, we nurture the seeds of change and the respect for human life to fundamentally transform our societies and institutions. We work with people and partners worldwide, of all faiths and backgrounds, to meet urgent community needs, challenge injustice, and build peace.\n**************************\nAcompáñenos a la proyección, de una sola noche de estreno, del nuevo documental \"And Water Brings Tomorrow\". Tras la proyección, habrá una sesión de preguntas y respuestas en vivo con la cineasta Ashley Hunt.\n\nAnd Water Brings Tomorrow es una película que examina a los cárceles \ncerradas por la comunidad, considerando en qué se han convertido, los esfuerzos comunitarios tras su cierre y las formas de pérdida y la reflexión que su cierre aborda y no aborda.\n\nSe incluye unas meriendas ligeras. \n\nBoletos: Las entradas son gratuitas, pero se agradecen las donaciones en la puerta para apoyar nuestra campaña local Shut Down GEO. Se sugiere una donación de $10, $15 o $20. No se rechazará a nadie por falta de fondos. https://secure.afsc.org/a/shut-down-geo\n\n\nAnfitriones:\n\"Cierren GEO Aurora\" es una coalición de personas y organizaciones que buscan cerrar la prisión con fines de lucro del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE), administrada por GEO Group, Inc en Aurora, CO. La coalición está trabajando con la comunidad para visualizar nuevos usos para el terreno y el edificio, y para luchar contra una próxima renovación de contrato.\n\nEl Comité de Justicia y Paz de Denver (DJPC) es una organización de base que promueve los derechos humanos, la justicia económica y ambiental a través de la educación y el activismo no violento para apoyar a las comunidades y buscar la justicia para todas las personas. Nos solidarizamos con los pueblos de las Américas, en particular con las comunidades oprimidas de Latinoamérica.\n\nEl Comité de Servicio de los Amigos Americanos (AFSC) promueve un mundo libre de violencia, desigualdad y opresión.

It reclaims patriotism from authoritarianism, rejecting the militarization of civic identity in favor of multiracial solidarity, joy, and collective memory.\n\nWhy June 14?\nJune 14 is Flag Day. It is also Donald Trump’s birthday. In 2025, Trump has planned a military parade to mark the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. The People’s Parade offers a defiant and joyful alternative: honoring the people who have always made America, not the weapons that claim to defend it.\n\n“This isn’t just a protest—it’s a promise. We’re showing the world what real patriotism looks like: people showing up for each other, not power saluting itself.”",

It really helps.  Make it fun, bring a friend. \nNo experience needed - just enthusiasm and dedication to the cause!",

And they're making the cuts to give huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.\n\nMany hospitals around the state could lose major funding. Kern Medical Hospital receives 72% of it's funding through Medicaid.  The proposed cuts would mean devastating cutbacks in services and longer wait times - even for people who have private insurance.  \n\nTo stop the cuts and save lives we need to get a handful of Republican Congressmembers to vote NO on the proposed healthcare cuts.  We'll be rallying to save Kern Medical Hospital on Tuesday, May 13th at 11:30 am with doctors, nurses, other healthcare providers and community supporters to call on Congressman David Valadao to vote NO on any cuts to Medicaid!",

Stand out for a different agenda and values than those represented by the new administration in DC! \n\nWe want to spread our presence over the 14-mile route. \n\nAfter you sign up, you will get a confirmation email. It will include an option to \"Contact the organizer.\" Please click on that and let us know which of the five towns (Topsfield, Ipswich, Rowley, Newbury, or Newburyport) you would like to stand out in. We have identified good locations (safe and with parking) within each town, and we will later suggest a specific location to you so that we balance our numbers along the route.",

We are coming together as a community to hold each other up, protect each other, and fight for our values. To do this we will grit our teeth, look forward, put one foot in front of the other, and work relentlessly to prevail over anti-democratic extremism. \n\nWe come from a variety of backgrounds and lived experiences, but we share so much in common. We believe that immigrants, BIPOC, and LGBTQ+ people deserve to feel safe, have respect, and be cared for in our community. We believe women should have freedom to make their own healthcare decisions. And we acknowledge that America has yet to live up to its true promise – but we shall continue to strive to get us all there, together. **Indivisible. With Liberty and Justice for all.**",

Why is Lawler choosing \"DOGE\" over our country? Maybe its the $1.7 million (million!) dollars Elon Musk paid Lawler for this past campaign alone. Join us Saturday for an extra special Lawler - Musk Takedown!\"\n\nWe are taking action at this Tesla-owned dealership. We are asking people to line the sidewalks in front of the dealership in a peaceful protest. This dealership is a few blocks from the MetroNorth station in Mt Kisco. We will be there from 1 to 3 p.m. on Saturdays. Bring a sign (a folding chair if you want). Bring the kids.\n\nOur nation is under attack from within. The time to yell at the news or tune out the world is over. We need to stand up now, or soon, we won’t be able to. I cannot tell you what to do, but I have spent my Saturdays in front of the Tesla-owned dealership in Northern Westchester, protesting the destruction of our democracy.\n\nPlease join us on Saturdays from 1 to 3. Bring your best signs and bring friends. It is letting the public know our opposition to this theft of our democracy and the rampant corruption that entails. We can also show our strong opposition to abandoning global friends and surrendering to our enemies.",

The Commissioners have enormous power when it comes to awarding contracts and deciding how our county tax dollars will be allocated.\n\nTheir meetings are far from resident-friendly--held as they are in the middle of the workday. But it's essential that Camden County residents keep an eye on this often overlooked level of government. There's little to no reporting on the decision making of our county government and if we don't attend, all we can expect is Norcross machine PR spin. \n\nSo it's up to us. We can bread and circuses or justice. \n\n**Please join us in working to keep our county government accountable to the people! We deserve officials who are elected, not appointed! The public money's deserve a fair accounting. That can only happen if we show up!**",
